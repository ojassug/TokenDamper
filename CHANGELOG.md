# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

> **Entries citing retired documents are deliberate.** Audit M11 retired twelve narrative files;
> older entries still name them, because a changelog records what was true at the time and
> rewriting it would falsify that. See `docs/retired-documents.md` for where each conclusion
> lives now and how to read the original out of git.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **The repository moved to `ojassug/TokenDamper`.** `package.json`'s `repository` and `homepage`,
  and the README's `git clone` line, now point there. The old `Epichlo/TokenDamper` URL redirects
  today, but a redirect ends if that name is ever reused, so nothing should depend on it. The npm
  package page picks the links up at the next publish — 1.8.0 on the registry carries the old
  ones, and they redirect.

### Fixed
- **The Gateway timeout file's other two header budgets also sat inside their own first byte's
  range.** The slow-body case's flake, fixed in v1.8.0, had siblings in the same file. All
  figures are from three concurrent full-suite runs, the load that reproduced it.
  - `delivers a stream whose body outlives the timeout budget` makes the file's first `fetch`, so
    its first byte also pays the HTTP client's one-time setup. It took a median of **67 ms** and
    up to **158 ms** against a **120 ms** budget, and the test failed 1 run in 18 in both earlier
    batches. The budget is now **500 ms**, with 250 ms gaps and 1.25 s of body. Those are the old
    proportions (gaps 0.5×, body 2.5×), so a per-chunk timer still passes this case by design;
    the slow-body case is the one that catches it.
  - `still aborts the upstream when the client hangs up mid-stream` was never reported flaky.
    The same measurement found it: one of its first bytes took **186 ms** against **120 ms**, and
    it passed only because the late timer lost a race inside the event loop. A 504 there can also
    pass vacuously, because the timeout closes the very upstream socket the test watches. Its
    budget only has to stay out of the way, so it is **500 ms** too; the test runs no longer for
    it.

  **Mutation-checked** against `main`'s file, 3 runs each, across five implementations: the three
  broken timers, plus §66's own check for the hangup case (a fetch signal without its
  client-disconnect half). All five rows match between the two files. Each broken timer fails the
  same cases as before, and the dropped disconnect fails only the hangup case. The file then failed
  **0 of 18** runs under three concurrent suites, and 5 of 5 single-suite runs were green.
  - **The slow-body case keeps 250 ms, but its comment was corrected.** It claimed "twice the
    worst case" from 121 ms. Pooled over 156 warm requests the worst is 186 ms, which 250 ms
    clears, though not twice.
  - **Cost:** test-only; the file takes ~4.5 s instead of ~3.5 s, and `bench.test.ts` is still
    the longest file.

## [v1.8.0] - 2026-09-24

**R2 and R3 of the road to v2.0 reach the registry, together.** R2 stopped the constraint gate
firing on descriptive comments (§77) and added a latency instrument (§76); R3 added the
`ParserAdapter` seam and an opt-in Deep path behind `--engine-mode deep` (§79–§81). Neither was
cut on its own, so upgrading from 1.7.4 delivers both.

**A minor, because the default path's output moves.** §77 stops reading a present-tense
descriptive `never`/`always` as a directive, and over the frozen corpus **10 files that fell back
now reduce, with 0 new fallbacks** — the same command over the same input emits different bytes,
which is §53's threshold for a minor. Nothing was removed.

**What changes for someone upgrading:**

- **More files reduce instead of falling back** (§77). Paired over the 507 rows that reduce in
  both arms, none changed a byte: the whole gain is fallbacks becoming reductions.
- **Every trace carries a new `parserCoverage` block**, the default fast path included
  (`mode: "fast"`, `registeredLanguages: []`, `backendAnswered: 0`). Anything that parses the
  trace strictly sees a new field.
- **`--engine-mode fast|deep` is new on `optimize`; `fast` is the default and is what ran
  before.** `deep` needs the companion package `tokendamper-deep`, which stays **unpublished until
  R4**, so from the npm package `--engine-mode deep` exits 1 with an error naming what it tried —
  never a silent Fast run. Its "build it first" hint applies to a repository checkout, where deep
  mode runs once the workspace is installed and `packages/deep` is built.

Also here: a load-sensitive Gateway test fixed (test-only), and the §76 harness and a corpus-recipe
update under `tools/`, which the package does not ship.

### Added
- **Deep `regions()` and `--engine-mode fast|deep` — R3 step 3 of three, closing R3 (DECISIONS
  §81).** `packages/deep` answers region discovery for TypeScript, Python and Go, reachable as
  `tokendamper optimize <file> --engine-mode deep`. Deep replaces **candidate discovery only** —
  `dropOverlapping`, `MIN_REGION_BYTES`, `isSubstantiveRegion` and the ceiling path all stay in
  core and run over the backend's candidates unchanged. Measured over one frozen 297-file corpus
  at ratio 0.3: **540 of 594 rows identical**, python file route **17.75% → 22.26%**, typescript
  **20.35% → 20.20%**, and target adherence improving from **12 to 20** of 54 differing rows
  landing in the 25–35% band. Go is 158 of 160 identical with zero new fallbacks.
  - **Three languages through the live path, not four.** No Fast validator returns the language
    `javascript`, so a JavaScript backend could never be resolved and is left unregistered.
  - **Five rows newly fall back**, all `CONSTRAINT_DIRECTIVE_LOST` on regions Deep found and Fast
    missed. Recorded rather than fixed — a strict superset on two of the three failing files,
    disjoint on the third, and net fallbacks fell (8 recovered against 5 new).
  - **Known convention divergence, characterized not fixed:** Deep starts a Python body after a
    leading `#` comment where Fast includes it. 16 of 45 pip corpus files carry that shape, and
    in 3 the excluded comment drops the span under `MIN_REGION_BYTES` so Deep declines the region.
- **`validationMode`, a separate axis from `engineMode`, defaulting to `fast`.** Deep's `check()`
  rejects TokenDamper's own elision marker, so deep validation and elision cannot be combined:
  with both live, a file went **292 → 292 tokens with a fallback** against **292 → 211** in fast
  mode. This is the Issue 2 post-condition becoming reachable for the first time, not a new
  defect. Deep validation stays reachable in the API and is what §80 measured.
- **`trace.parserCoverage`**, reporting the mode, the registered languages, and how many items a
  Deep backend answered for — so `--engine-mode deep` producing byte-identical output and
  `--engine-mode deep` never having run stop being the same observation. **It is emitted on every
  run, fast included** (reading `mode: "fast"`, `backendAnswered: 0`), so anything parsing the
  trace sees a new field on the default path even if it never passes `--engine-mode`.

- **Deep `check()`, and the validator disagreement measurement — R3 step 2 of three (DECISIONS
  §80).** `packages/deep` reads tree-sitter's `ERROR` and `MISSING` nodes and reports them as an
  `AstCheckResult`. Nothing on the optimize route moves: **586/586 corpus rows byte-identical**,
  `src/` untouched. §46 and §75 stand — the Fast path's advertised guarantee is still
  bracket/quote integrity and `validator-guarantee.test.ts` is unchanged.

  **The inverse control runs per language**, because §60's second half is the one that gets
  skipped: 0 findings is also what a validator that examines nothing reports. Brace deletion is
  meaningless for Python, so Python gets a `def` header with its colon removed rather than a
  control that silently proves nothing.

  | language | files | rate | deep-only | fast-only |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | python | 13,897 | 8.03% | 6 | 1,110 |
  | go | 8,251 | **0.85%** | 70 | 0 |
  | typescript | 1,164 | 9.28% | 108 | 0 |
  | javascript | 1,823 | 0.11% | 0 | 2 |

  **Both validators are wrong, in opposite directions.** Fast rejects **1,110 valid Python
  files** — 99.5% of them a backslash line continuation read as an unexpected indent, classified
  across every one rather than generalised from an example; `argparse.py` compiles under CPython
  and is rejected at L1701. Fast also rejects 2 valid `.js` files carrying JSX. And Deep rejects
  valid source of its own, every case the **grammar lagging the language**: generic import types
  `import("m").R<A, B>`, `global {}` nested in `declare module`, `export type *`, `abstract` as a
  property name, Go's `new(expr)` and generic methods, Python's starred returns. Minimal repros
  were bisected — a first pass blamed 86 TypeScript files on a construct that parses fine.

  Deep is also **right twice**: two CPython `badsyntax_*` fixtures that Fast passes. Every Python
  verdict was adjudicated against `py_compile`.

  **A grammar is a versioned artifact that trails its language**, which is a failure mode this
  project has not had before — a hand-written lexer drifts only when edited. `new(expr)` landed in
  `golang/go` two weeks before this measurement. R4 needs a grammar-version policy.

  Two of four languages miss §3.5's ≥5,000 bar (typescript 1,164, javascript 1,823) and the
  harness prints the shortfall on every run. The Python indentation defect is worth **0 of the 10**
  Python fallbacks on the frozen corpus — L7's lesson again, and why the survey used 13,897 files.

- **The `ParserAdapter` seam, and the Deep backend's `symbols()` — R3 step 1 of three (DECISIONS
  §79).** `src/core/parser/` ships the interface and the registry and **bundles no
  implementation**, the shape `TokenizerAdapter` already uses. `selectValidator` takes an
  `EngineMode`: `fast` is the default and never reads the registry, `deep` reads it and falls
  back to the same shipped chain. Deep keys off the language the shipped chain resolves, so it
  adds **no new language**.

  `packages/deep/` (`tokendamper-deep`, private) carries `web-tree-sitter` and four grammars.
  **Core's `devDependencies` are unchanged**; the only edit to core's `package.json` is
  `"workspaces"`. `npm pack --dry-run` reports 229 files / 2.0 MB with zero `packages/deep` or
  tree-sitter matches — the +6 over the documented 223 is exactly `dist/src/core/parser/`.

  **Nothing on the optimize route moved: 586/586 corpus rows byte-identical on all 15 compared
  fields.** `check()` and `regions()` *throw* rather than returning `valid: true` or `[]`, because
  both are indistinguishable from a backend that examined nothing.

  **Step 1's assertion as written is wrong, and the corpus is what showed it.** §3.5 asks that
  `S_k` never fall; it fell on **9 of 75** transformed files, five to `0.0000`. Every one was
  read, and none is §59's hazard: all nine are Deep *declining* to harvest symbols the shipped
  regexes invented out of English prose in comments. `src/core/validation/language-support.ts`
  scores `driftScore: 0.1667` entirely on `type:keeps`, matched out of *"the content type keeps
  the message concrete"*. The criterion that replaces the wording — a symbol Deep **has** that
  Fast saw destroyed and Deep retained — measures **0 files**.

  **Three disagreements were refused rather than adopted**, all cases where Deep is more correct
  and adopting it would *lower* drift because the symbol survives body elision by construction:
  Go **grouped** `const/type/import ( … )` blocks (**142 symbols** on the 80-file Go corpus, the
  largest by far), the 20 annotated top-level constants the shipped `var:` regex cannot reach, and
  typed blank-identifier assertions. Go extras end at **0**.

  **Go inverts the drift effect and that is what makes the story coherent**: `S_k` *rose* on 36 of
  60 Go files and fell on 1, because Go doc comments sit *above* functions and are retained, where
  this repository’s TypeScript comments sit *inside* bodies and are destroyed. Hazard count across
  TypeScript, Python and Go: **0**. New: `tools/corpus-harness/deep-parity.js` and
  `deep-drift-control.js`, both of which refuse an empty or untransformed comparison set.

- **A per-file latency harness (DECISIONS §76).** `tools/corpus-harness/timing-run.js`. R2's second
  half: `stageTraces[].durationMs` is per stage, and no field anywhere carried an end-to-end
  figure, so `ROADMAP.md`'s `<1ms` Fast / `~15ms` Deep targets were not merely unvalidated but
  unvalidatable. **A separate invocation from `measure.js`, which is not organisation** — wall clock
  is noisy and machine-dependent, byte-identity is deterministic and load-bearing, and folding them
  together would make a green identity result depend on machine load. `measure.js` is untouched.

  **It reports three numbers, because one would be wrong.** `cold` (git cache cleared per file,
  models the CLI), `warm` (cache retained, models the Gateway and MCP) and `fixed` (Node boot plus
  module load). Measured **cold p50 159.1ms against warm p50 3.8ms — a 41.48x ratio**, caused by
  `globalGitCache`'s 2000ms TTL. A harness that timed N files in one process and called the result
  per-file latency would have under-reported CLI cost forty-fold.

  Baseline: 292 files pinned at corpus `fcb6718`, ratio 0.3, **292/292 route parity**. Per stage,
  `pruning:topology-pruner` is **153.8ms of the 159.1ms** — 97%, and all of it `git status`; every
  other stage is sub-millisecond. Recorded rather than fixed, as off R2's scope.

  **The `<1ms` target was not wrong, it was unqualified**, which is the more useful finding: it
  resolves to 159.1ms end-to-end cold, 3.8ms end-to-end warm, or ~0.7ms for the reduction stages
  alone, and the roadmap never said which. A target that does not name its quantity can be neither
  validated nor falsified.

  The instrument refuses three things, each added because the run producing it looked fine: an
  empty sample, a coverage gap between the two routes, and **a run that attributed no stage** —
  which the first baseline run did on all 292 files, because `timeOnce` read `result.trace` and
  `runCli` returns an exit code. No `src/` change, so no corpus run is owed.

### Changed
- **A present-tense descriptive `never`/`always` is no longer a directive (DECISIONS §77).** §52
  exempted only *perfect and past* constructions, so `// Should never happen, but we ...` — the
  shape recorded as dominating Go's fallbacks — fell straight through. Surveyed first: **322**
  such segments are unexempt on the frozen corpus and only **3** are caught today.

  Three rules, each provable from the words present rather than from tone. **A third-person `-s`
  cannot be an imperative**, because an English imperative is a bare infinitive — so
  `never returns` describes while `never return` instructs (99 of 322). A **copula** states a
  property (39). And **non-agentive verbs** (`happen`, `occur`, `exist`, `arise`, `matter`) have
  no imperative form at all, which exempts `should never happen` without trusting the modal.
  **Modals keep firing**, 38 segments, on purpose: `should never call this` instructs.

  **Measured two-sided, per language, engine varied and input frozen.** Main corpus 584 rows,
  Go 160 rows on the separate 80-file corpus: **10 files recovered, 0 new fallbacks**, 734 of 744
  rows byte-identical. Per bucket — python 32→34 reduced (fallbacks 12→10), typescript 38→41
  (18→15), go-app 32→34 (8→6), go-stdlib 25→26 (12→11).

  **Paired over the 507 rows that reduce under both arms, the mean is unchanged and zero of them
  changed a byte.** Nothing that already worked moved; the whole gain is fallbacks becoming
  reductions. Unlike §52, which gained 6pp on TypeScript and zero on Python, **all four buckets
  gain**, and 4 of 7 main-corpus recoveries are pip's own source rather than this repository's.

  Also a **correction to §52**: `isNarrativeUse` tested the whole segment, so one narrative
  construction anywhere exempted everything in it — `the value is always set, so always check it
  first` was already losing its instruction. The check is now per occurrence and unanimous.

- **Corpus recipe: typescript 62→63, prose 17→21.** Entirely pre-existing drift, surfaced because
  R2 is the first corpus run since v1.6.1 — `src/core/validation/ast/go-validator.ts` (DECISIONS
  §60) plus four documents. Reduction aggregates from here are over the new counts and are not
  comparable to earlier ones. `collect.js` refusing its own recipe is it working.

### Fixed
- **The Gateway's slow-body timeout test flaked under load, and what failed was never the
  property it pins.** `gateway upstream timeout > does not truncate a slow body just because the
  budget is small` pins DECISIONS §66 — the upstream budget is time-to-first-byte, so a slow body
  is never cut — and ran it as a **40 ms** budget against 8 chunks 50 ms apart. Under load it
  failed as `504 {"error":"Gateway Timeout: upstream sent no response headers within 40ms"}`: the
  header budget expiring before the in-process upstream answered, not a body being truncated.
  Test-only; `src/` is untouched and `npm pack --dry-run` carries nothing from `test/integration`.

  Measured over whole-suite runs on the Windows dev machine: **0 of 15** failures with one suite
  running, **1 of 20** under two concurrent suites, **2 of 18** under three. It passed alone
  because the first byte is a round trip through the worker's own event loop, which a lone run
  never starves. With the `fetch` the budget races wrapped and the budget lifted, the first byte
  under three suites took a median of **29 ms**, p90 **65 ms** and at worst **121 ms** over 90
  requests — a 40 ms budget sat inside the distribution.

  Now **250 ms** against 5 chunks **500 ms** apart. The body is still **10×** the budget, and each
  gap is **2×** it where it was 1.25× — a 10 ms margin, less than one Windows timer tick. Under
  three concurrent suites it failed **0 of 18**, and ten single-suite runs were green. The test
  takes ~2.6 s instead of ~0.5 s; the suite's wall time did not measurably move (10.6 s → 10.7 s
  mean), because `bench.test.ts` at ~6 s is still the longest file.

  **Mutation-checked**, original and new file side by side, 3 runs each. A total-duration timer
  and a timer restarted at headers fail tests 1 and 4 in both; a per-chunk idle timer fails
  **only test 4** in both, so it is still the one test that catches that. Every mutant failure is
  `Error: aborted` — the truncation signature, distinct from the flake's 504 — which is why the
  status assertion now carries the body as its message: `expected 504 to be 200` alone did not
  say which failure it was.

  **Not fixed, and exposed the same way:** `delivers a stream whose body outlives the timeout
  budget`, at 120 ms. It makes the file's first `fetch`, so its first byte also pays the HTTP
  client's one-time setup — a median of **72 ms** and up to **158 ms** under three suites — and it
  failed **1 of 18** there in both arms.


## [v1.7.4] - 2026-09-19

**The 2026-08-30 security remediation reaches the registry.** Every finding in
`docs/security-review-2026-08-30.md` — the F, V and S series, across seven sessions including
two independent falsification passes, one over the findings and one over the fixes — plus three
`oxaudit.md` tooling items (OX-L8, L17, L18) and the README restructure.

**Upgrading from the published 1.7.2 delivers v1.7.3 as well.** v1.7.3 was tagged 2026-09-01 and
never published; its section below is left as the record of what was tagged rather than folded in
here. `DriftCoverage.symbolBearingItems` changes meaning there, on **254 of 580** corpus rows —
read that section if anything you own parses the trace.

**Registry `1.7.3` is deprecated, and it is not the `v1.7.3` tag.** This release was first
published from a checkout that had not pulled the release merge, so npm read the *old*
`package.json` and put the pre-merge tree on the registry as **1.7.3** — the security
remediation under a number whose git tag holds a tree **663 insertions** away. Nothing unsafe
shipped and no consumer was stranded, because 1.7.3 had never been published before; the number
is simply ambiguous, so it is deprecated in favour of 1.7.4. **`npm view tokendamper version` is
still the only thing that says what a consumer gets.**

**Numbered a patch although output moved. That is an explicit call at ship time, not the rule
changing.** §53's threshold for a minor is *"the same command over the same input emits different
bytes"*, and four changes here clear it: S-02 and F-06 escape envelope labels, S-03 and F-05
rebuild trace messages from a fixed vocabulary, and OX-L8 stops a signal truncating the MCP
stream. The patch digit was chosen so a `~1.7.2` range picks this up without intervention,
because it is a security release. **Do not read it as evidence that nothing moved** — v1.6.1 is
the precedent and carries the same caveat.

**What changes behaviour, before what was fixed:**

- **The Gateway refuses an upstream redirect** (S-04), returning a 502 naming the status where it
  previously followed one. Demonstrated end to end delivering `x-api-key` to a stand-in metadata
  listener. Neither `api.openai.com` nor `api.anthropic.com` redirects an API POST, so nothing
  anyone does today changes; an endpoint that does redirect needs its destination configured as
  the upstream URL.
- **A Gateway request to an unknown route no longer mints a session** (S-01) — reachable from a
  web page, which is the attacker the origin gate exists for, because a no-cors GET sends no
  `Origin` header at all.
- **`GatewaySessionStore.getContent` refuses a ref shorter than 12 characters** (F-02). No
  shipping caller is narrowed; the only producer emits a 12-character prefix.
- **`--diff-html` writes its report `0600`** (F-04), where it previously landed at 644.

Fixes from the 2026-08-30 security review (`docs/security-review-2026-08-30.md`), which ran seven
sessions including two independent falsification passes — one over the findings, one over the
fixes. Findings are cited by their report ID.

### Fixed
- **A JSON syntax error no longer quotes the payload back into the trace (security review S-03).**
  `JsonValidator` forwarded V8's `JSON.parse` message verbatim, and one of its forms embeds the
  input: `Unexpected token 'q', ..."Ab9x","r":qq}" is not valid JSON` — roughly fifteen characters
  either side of the error, and **for a document shorter than that window, all of it**. That string
  reaches `ValidationIssue.message`, is joined into `reason`, and lands in `trace.fallbackReason`,
  which the CLI writes to stderr on every run. It is the defect F-05 fixed for constraint
  directives, on the same field, through a sibling message nobody had looked at.

  The message is now built from a fixed vocabulary — a prefix match against a seventeen-entry
  table returning this file's own constants, never a slice of V8's string — plus the validator's
  own line and column: `JSON Syntax Error: unexpected token at line 2, column 1`. The offending
  character goes too, because it is also a byte of the payload and the position already identifies
  it for anyone holding the input. An unrecognised form degrades to `invalid JSON`, so a future
  Node makes the message vaguer rather than leakier. Shapes were enumerated against Node 22 and
  26, which agree; only the `Unexpected token` family ever carried input. The sibling validators
  were checked and interpolate positions and structural characters only.
- **The gateway does not follow an upstream redirect (security review S-04).** `forwardUpstreamRequest`
  set no `redirect` option, so `fetch` defaulted to `follow` — while §6.3's guard runs once, at
  `start()`, on the configured base URL. A `302` is not that string. Demonstrated end to end: a
  stub provider redirecting to a stand-in metadata listener delivered **`x-api-key`** to it, and
  the gateway relayed that listener's body to the caller as a 200. `authorization` was stripped —
  but by undici implementing the Fetch spec's cross-origin rule, not by anything here, and
  `x-api-key` is a vendor header on no such list.

  `redirect: 'manual'` now, and a 3xx becomes a **502** naming the status. The `Location` header is
  upstream-controlled and is deliberately not echoed. **This is a behavioural change**: an upstream
  that answers a redirect now fails instead of being followed. Neither `api.openai.com` nor
  `api.anthropic.com` redirects an API POST, so nothing anyone does today changes; an endpoint that
  does redirect needs its destination configured as the upstream URL, which leaves the §6.3 guard
  covering it. No new flag — following safely would mean re-validating `Location`, deciding what to
  strip and bounding the hops, for a case no provider needs.
- **The gateway creates a session only on a route that uses one (security review S-01).** The
  credential check hoisted in the previous round is conditioned on `isApiRoute`;
  `getOrCreateSession` ran above the route dispatch and was not. So `POST /v1/anything` and
  `GET /nope` answered 404 and minted a session on the way there, with **no credential of any
  kind** — 20 unauthenticated POSTs to an unknown endpoint produced 20 sessions, and 120 `GET`s
  naming chosen ids over one connection produced 100, the store's entire `maxSessions` cap.

  **Reachable from a web page, which is the attacker the origin gate exists for.** A no-cors GET
  carries no `Origin` header at all — the Fetch spec appends one only for CORS-tainted requests or
  non-GET/HEAD methods — so V-02's refusal never sees it, and the `Host` check passes because the
  browser really is talking to `127.0.0.1`. Driven from a page on another port against a live
  gateway: 400 requests, 400 connections, **0 carrying `Origin`**, `sessionCount` 100, and a
  victim session seeded beforehand evicted along with its stored content. The same page after the
  fix leaves `sessionCount` at **1** — the victim's, content intact.

  The session is now opened inside the two API branches, and the 404 reports none.
  `ProxyRequestResult.session` has been optional since the hoist and nothing reads it. **Unchanged:
  a local process still passes `hasAuthHeaders` with any string and may still name any session id**
  — that is the `exec` trust boundary (audit C3), not something this closes.
- **The CLI's fallback renderer escapes its envelope label too (security review S-02).** F-06
  escaped `\r` and `\n` in `core/render`'s `itemLabel`; `renderFallbackBytes` in `cli/main.ts`
  emits the same `==> … <==` header over each file's original bytes on the fail-open path, and
  built it by interpolating `file.path` raw. A POSIX filename may contain a newline, so a crafted
  name still broke the header across lines there and planted a second, well-formed header naming a
  file that does not exist. Measured on ext4, one directory: **3 headers optimized, 4 on fallback**,
  the extra one followed by the attacker's chosen line. The attacker forces the fallback with one
  file of their own that is not valid UTF-8.

  The escaping is now an exported `escapeDelimiterLabel` in `core/render`, next to the delimiters
  it protects, and both renderers call it — duplicating the `replace` chain is how the two
  diverged. Only the header is escaped; `file.bytes` still passes through untouched, because
  emitting the caller's original bytes is why that path exists (DECISIONS §35). **No corpus row
  moves**: no corpus file has a newline in its name. README needed no edit — its claim that "a
  crafted name cannot introduce a header line" is simply true again, on both routes.
- **`GatewaySessionStore.getContent` no longer resolves an arbitrarily short hash prefix
  (security review F-02).** The prefix scan returned stored plaintext whenever exactly one hash
  started with the supplied ref, with no minimum length — so `ref=a` recovered a block's content
  in roughly 16 guesses per hex digit, and `ref=` (empty) recovered it in **none** whenever the
  session held a single block, because `startsWith('')` matches every hash. Both were reachable
  from a string rather than only from an API call: `normalizeHashOrRef` extracts `ref=` out of a
  marker-shaped argument, and one character forms a well-formed marker.

  A ref shorter than `ELISION_HASH_PREFIX_LENGTH` (12) is now refused before the scan, mirroring
  the guard `TokenHasher.resolve` has always had. **No shipping caller is narrowed**: the only
  producer, `cleanup:session-dedup`, emits `item.contentHash.slice(0, 12)`. A full digest is still
  accepted at any length, because the exact-match branch runs first.

  No entry mode reached this today — the MCP session store is never populated — so it was filed as
  latent. It becomes live for any embedder that hands a populated Gateway store to
  `createMcpServer({ sessionStore })`, which the option exists to invite.
### Added
- **Architecture import rules are policed, not just described (audit OX-L17, DECISIONS §72).** Two
  bans, both via `@typescript-eslint/no-restricted-imports` — **no new dependency.** The audit
  suggested `eslint-plugin-boundaries` or dependency-cruiser and §69 deferred the item on that
  cost; the rules this repository actually has are two import bans, and the linter already
  expresses them.

  Invariant 4: only `src/core/stage-registry` may value-import a concrete stage. Layering:
  `src/core` and `src/stages` may not import from `adapters/`, `cli/` or `gateway/`.
  `allowTypeImports` permits `import type`, which is erased and couples nothing.

  **Both were verified by planting the violation they should catch**, because a misconfigured lint
  rule looks exactly like a clean codebase. Value import from a stage → error; `import type` from a
  stage → passes; upward import → error.

  Writing the rule found that **invariant 4 is not what the code does**:
  `core/validation/index.ts:13` value-imports `extractConstraintDirectives` from
  `stages/cleanup/constraint-preservation`. Exempted at that one path with the reason at the site
  rather than refactored — moving the extractor changes the optimize route, which needs a corpus
  measurement, and a linter commit should not carry one.
- **Coverage reporting (audit OX-L18, DECISIONS §72).** `npm run coverage`, via
  `@vitest/coverage-v8`. **Reporting only — `npm test` does not run it and no threshold fails a
  build**, deliberately: a number attached to a gate becomes a target, and several suites here
  exist to pin a characterization that a coverage gate would reward deleting.

  Baseline over `src/**`: statements **92.54%**, branches **87.20%**, functions **97.01%**.
  `coverage/` was already gitignored and contributes 0 entries to `npm pack`, checked rather than
  assumed.

### Fixed
- **A signal no longer truncates the MCP output stream (audit OX-L8).** `process.exit()` discards
  whatever a stream still holds, so `tokendamper mcp` exiting the instant `stop()` returned lost
  any JSON-RPC frame still buffered. Shutdown now waits for the output stream to report its write
  flushed, under a 2 s cap.

  **Measured end to end, because the platform decides whether this exists at all.** Node's stdout
  is synchronous for pipes on Windows and Linux and asynchronous on macOS, and the buffer only
  overflows on a large frame. Driving the real `tokendamper mcp` on Linux — a 900 kB response with
  SIGINT delivered mid-stream — **365,696 bytes arrived and the final frame did not parse**,
  against **900,819 bytes and a whole frame** with the fix. On Windows the same payload was never
  truncated.

  This was previously recorded rather than fixed, and the recorded reason was verifiability: SIGINT
  could not be exercised from the suite, so the change would ship unverified, and the fix
  contemplated then — dropping the forced exit to let the loop drain — risked hanging on Ctrl+C.
  Both halves are answered. The exit is still forced, merely deferred until the stream reports a
  flush or the cap fires, so a stuck consumer cannot wedge shutdown; and
  `test/unit/cli/sigint-flush.test.ts` pins the ordering deterministically by holding the write
  callback rather than waiting on a clock. **All three of its cases fail against the unfixed
  handler**, which is what makes them worth having.

  One approach measured and rejected: awaiting `server.stop()`. `stop()` is `(): void`, so the
  await yields one microtask, and a microtask does not run the I/O loop that drains a pipe — it
  delivered **146,176 bytes of 1,000,046, byte for byte identical to no fix at all**.
- **The egress splice resolves a JSON key written with an escape (security review V-03).**
  V-01's fix made the scan last-match-wins, which handled *literal* duplicate keys. It still
  compared the undecoded source slice against `'content'` — but `"content"` **is** `content`
  to `JSON.parse`, so the parser resolved the duplicate to the escaped key's value while the
  scanner matched only the literal one, and V-01's exact corruption returned by another route.
  Reproduced end to end *after* V-01 was fixed. The key is decoded with `JSON.parse` now, which is
  the only comparison that cannot disagree with the parser downstream.

  Found by falsifying V-01's own fix. Worth noting how it survived: the fix passed four unit tests
  and an end-to-end reproduction, all of which shared the fix's assumption about what a key is.
- **The egress splice no longer overwrites the wrong value when a message repeats a JSON key
  (security review V-01).** `findMemberValue` returned the **first** match while `JSON.parse`
  resolves a duplicate name to the **last** — and the pipeline optimizes what the parser produced,
  while the span says where to write it back. Given `{"content":"A","content":"B"}` the engine
  reasoned about `B` and the splice overwrote `A`: the forwarded body lost `A` outright, still
  carried `B` unelided, and gained a marker the provider cannot resolve. `forwardableBody`'s
  never-grow guard does not catch it, because the corruption makes the body shorter. Same
  divergence on Anthropic's `system` field. Now last-match-wins, matching the parser.
- **`Origin: null` is refused rather than exempted (security review V-02).** The browser-origin
  guard read `originHeader !== 'null'`, so the one `Origin` value a browser sends when it is *most*
  sandboxed — a sandboxed iframe, a `data:` URL, some redirect chains — was the one value that
  walked past it. An absent `Origin` still passes, because that is the non-browser client; the
  literal string `null` is a browser declining to name itself, which is not the same thing.
- **An unauthenticated Gateway request no longer creates a session (security review F-01
  residual).** The credential check ran *after* the stages, so a request ending in 401 had already
  created a session, stored its blocks and advanced the turn counter — and an empty session still
  occupies a slot under `maxSessions`, which is the whole eviction primitive.

  **This fix was previously refused, and the reversal is the interesting part.** It was assessed as
  vacuous because `hasAuthHeaders` tests presence rather than validity: a local process passes it
  with `Bearer anything`. That held for one attacker and there are two — V-02 showed a browser
  reaches this handler, and a browser cannot set `authorization` on a simple request at all, since
  the header is not CORS-safelisted and asking for it forces a preflight this server refuses.
  Measured after the fix: 20 unauthenticated requests leave `sessionCount` at 0. A rejected method
  no longer creates one either.

  `ProxyRequestResult.session` is optional as a consequence — a 401 or 405 now has no session to
  report. No consumer reads that field off a result.
- **The Gateway refuses an unsafe upstream base URL before it listens (security review §6.3).**
  `buildUpstreamUrl` trimmed a slash and concatenated with no validation of any kind, while
  `buildForwardHeaders` delivers the caller's `Authorization` / `x-api-key` to whatever came out —
  R-06 demonstrated a one-line config change putting a live-looking bearer token on an arbitrary
  listener, and `169.254.169.254` is the destination that makes it worth doing. `start()` now
  refuses a URL that is not `https:` or that names a literal private, loopback or link-local
  address, with `allowInsecureUpstream` as the named opt-in.

  Refused at `start()` rather than per request, following OX-M8's reasoning: a misconfiguration
  that would leak a credential is named once where it can still be fixed, not surfaced as an opaque
  502 on every call. **Two limits, stated rather than glossed.** Literal addresses only — a
  *hostname* resolving into a private range is not caught, because this reads the configured string
  rather than the address the socket connects to, and resolving at startup would still leave a
  TOCTOU window. And the guard is on `GatewayServer.start()`, so a library caller invoking
  `handleProxyRequest` directly bypasses it.

  One bypass in the first draft was caught by its own test rather than by reading: `URL` normalises
  `[::ffff:169.254.169.254]` to `[::ffff:a9fe:a9fe]`, so a validator understanding only dotted
  IPv4-mapped notation passes **the metadata service itself**. Both spellings are handled.

  This finding was never filed in §3 — it sat in §6.3 as a library hazard because no CLI surface
  reaches it. That reasoning was inconsistent: F-02 was library-only on identical terms, was filed
  as a Medium, and was fixed. Fixing this closes the asymmetry from the other side.
- **Gateway clients that name no session no longer share one (security review F-01).**
  `getSessionIdFromHeaders` fell back to the literal `'default-session'`, so every client that set
  no session header landed in one session object — the *common* case, because the third-party tools
  `exec` exists to wrap generally set none. Two unrelated local processes then wrote into each
  other's dedup state, and a third could flush it: one request carrying 130 blocks drives
  `contentByHash` to its 100-entry cap and evicts everything already there.

  The fallback is now minted per connection and keyed on the socket, which is the only thing here a
  caller cannot choose — every peer is `127.0.0.1`, so the address discriminates nothing. Keep-alive
  keeps one client's turns in one session, so cross-turn dedup is unaffected. Measured: two
  connections now produce two sessions where they produced one, and a client's second turn on the
  same connection still lands in its own.

  **This narrows a default; it does not authenticate anything.** A client naming an explicit
  `x-session-id` can still bind to any id, including another client's — unchanged, and the
  documented `exec` trust boundary, since the peer is already trusted enough to proxy provider
  traffic through this process. What it removes is the collision nobody opted into. Also note
  session state is still mutated *before* any credential check, so a request that ends in 401 has
  already written to the store; that is recorded, not fixed.
- **`optimize <dir>` warns when it ingests files git is ignoring (security review F-03).**
  Ingestion is an extension allowlist and never consults `.gitignore`, so pointing it at a
  repository containing `secrets.yaml`, `serviceAccount.json` or `config/credentials.yaml` read all
  three and wrote them to stdout — the stream the caller then pipes into a model. It now names them
  on stderr.

  **It reports; it does not filter.** Skipping them would change which bytes the pipeline sees, and
  `.gitignore` covers plenty a caller may legitimately mean to optimize — build output, vendored
  sources, generated code. The query runs `git check-ignore --stdin -z` via `execFile` with an
  argument array and the paths on **stdin**, so no filename is ever interpolated into a command
  line and a path beginning with `-` cannot become a flag; `-z` also avoids git's `core.quotePath`
  C-quoting, which would otherwise print every Windows path escaped. Any failure — no git, no
  repository — is silent, because a warning system that errors is worse than one that says nothing.
  The query runs inside the tree being *read*, not the process's own: `git check-ignore` answers
  according to the repository it runs in, and asking this one about another one's paths reports
  nothing at all, silently.
- **The README now states that output markers are unauthenticated (security review F-07).** The
  `==> path <==` envelope and `[TokenDamper: … sha256:…]` marker are fixed, documented text shapes
  with no signature, so a marker or header sitting in an ingested file is indistinguishable from one
  the engine emitted — and the consumer is usually a model, which does not parse the envelope but
  believes it. Documented rather than fixed with a per-run nonce, which would change emitted bytes
  on every run and make output non-deterministic across runs, colliding with invariant 1. The note
  also records the practical discriminator: every genuine header on every CLI route carries an
  absolute path, so a header naming a bare or relative path did not come from the ingester.
- **A dropped constraint directive is no longer quoted verbatim into the trace (security review
  F-05).** `CONSTRAINT_DIRECTIVE_LOST` embedded the directive itself — an unbounded clause taken
  straight from the input — and that message becomes `trace.fallbackReason`, which is written to
  stderr on every CLI run and returned in full to an MCP client by `get_optimization_trace`. A line
  like `# CRITICAL: rotate token=sk-live-abc123 before Friday.` was copied out of the payload into
  a diagnostic channel that shell redirection and CI log capture take elsewhere.

  It now reports length, offset and a 12-character digest of the directive: enough to locate it for
  anyone holding the input, and enough for no one else. Truncation was the other candidate and was
  rejected on measurement — the secret in the report's reproduction begins at character 24 of a
  53-character line, so any cap wide enough to stay readable still emits it.

  **The affected population is wider than the report filed.** Session 4 found `.md` and `.txt`
  reach this with *no elision and no language support at all*, through whole-item hashing; the
  report had narrowed it to comments and docstrings in three languages inside an elided region.
  `validation-integration.test.ts` previously asserted the message *contained* the directive text;
  that assertion is inverted now, deliberately, and says why at the site.
- **A newline in a filename can no longer forge an envelope header (security review F-06).** A
  POSIX filename may contain any byte but `/` and NUL. The multi-item envelope prints
  `==> <item.path> <==` with nothing escaped, so a file named
  `notes.py\n==> security_policy.py <==\n…` broke the header across lines and planted a second,
  well-formed header naming a file that does not exist — while the attacker's real file appeared
  only as the malformed remainder, making the forgery read as the more legitimate of the two.
  Demonstrated end to end on ext4: three real files, four headers.

  Line breaks in the label are now escaped, so it stays one line: three files, three headers.
  Escaped rather than rejected, because a rejected path tells the reader nothing about which file
  they are looking at.

  **This closes the label vector only.** A delimiter-shaped line inside a file's *content* still
  passes through, because escaping content would corrupt the bytes this tool exists to deliver
  intact. That half is documented instead, and is mitigated by shape: every genuine label on every
  shipping CLI route is an absolute path, so a forged relative header does not match the form of
  the real ones unless the attacker knows the victim's checkout path. **No corpus row moves** —
  no file in the corpus has a newline in its name — which is a case of a real fix the instrument
  cannot see, not an inert one (compare OX-L7).
- **`--diff-html` writes its report `0600` (security review F-04).** The report embeds every
  item's complete before *and* after content, so it is a full plaintext copy of whatever was
  optimized. It was written with no `mode`, landing at `0666 & ~umask` — measured on ext4: **644**.
  Source that was `0600` became a world-readable copy, readable by any local user on a shared host
  or under a `/tmp` output path.

  Both a `mode` on the write and a following `chmodSync` are used, and the second is not
  redundant: `writeFileSync`'s `mode` applies only when the file is **created**, so overwriting an
  existing report would otherwise keep its older, wider mode. Verified on ext4 both ways — fresh
  file `600`, and a pre-existing `644` report narrowed to `600`. On Windows the mode bits are not
  the operative access control and this is a POSIX guarantee; the README now says so, and says
  that the report embeds full content.

### Changed
- **The README is restructured, and every figure in it was re-measured against the built
  artifact.** It now leads with a worked example and three Mermaid diagrams — the pipeline, the
  planner's three plan shapes, and the validation gate — before the reference material, and the
  caveats are gathered into one *What it does not do* section rather than scattered as retractions.
  No behaviour changes; this is a documentation edit.

  **Two measured claims in the old text did not survive re-running them**, which is the reason
  this entry exists rather than a bare "docs" line:

  - The knapsack feature bullet read "31 files in, **15 pruned, 20,540 tokens saved**" for
    `optimize ./src/core --max-input-tokens 4000`. Re-run against v1.7.3 that is 34 files and
    13 pruned for 17,823 tokens — **and the run falls back**, on 19 `CONSTRAINT_DIRECTIVE_LOST`
    plus drift at 0.42 against the 0.40 gate, so the caller receives **0.00%**. The figure was
    `pruning:topology-pruner`'s own stage metric quoted as a result. That is invariant 10's shape
    in the documentation: a number that reads as an outcome but describes something upstream of
    the gate. It is now written up under *It will not save you from a comment-heavy codebase*,
    with the fallback shown.
  - A first draft of the replacement claimed that undeclared TypeScript over stdin "falls back".
    It does not: `languageSupport.noneSupported` is true, `compression:token-hashing` finds no
    eligible item and skips it, and `fallbackUsed` stays `false` at a silent 0%. Caught by
    reading the trace instead of the token delta, before it shipped.

  Also corrected against source: the config example's `configSchemaVersion` is `1.1`, not
  `1.0.0`; `TOKENDAMPER_PLANNER_MODE` accepts `pass_through` only, and is now documented;
  Python over stdin is detected by the content probe without `--language`, which the old text
  implied it was not. The npm `latest` tag is recorded as **1.7.2** against this repository's
  `v1.7.3` — a tag here does not imply a registry version.

## [v1.7.3] - 2026-09-01

**Read this if anything you own parses the trace.** `DriftCoverage.symbolBearingItems` changes
meaning: it counted items an AST validator covered, and now counts items that actually yield
symbols. The number moves on **254 of 580** corpus rows, always upward.

**Numbered a patch because the optimized output does not move** — `outputSha` is identical on
all 580 rows, so the same command over the same input emits the same bytes on stdout. The change
is confined to the diagnostic trace on stderr and in the MCP response. If you consume only the
optimized text this release is inert for you; if you parse `driftCoverage`, treat it as
breaking and read DECISIONS §71 before upgrading.
### Fixed
- **`DriftCoverage.symbolBearingItems` counts symbols rather than validator coverage (DECISIONS
  §71).** It was `astCoverage.checked` computed a second way, under a name asserting a fact about
  symbols that nothing checked. `extractSymbols` is regexes over content with no language gate and
  `selectValidator` has four branches; the two agreed only while every language with symbols also
  had a validator.

  Both directions are real. Go between §59 and §60 reported `symbolsBefore >= 3` beside
  `symbolBearingItems: 0` on all 80 frozen Go files — §60 gave Go a validator, which removed Go
  from that population **without fixing the field**. The reverse case is in this repository: six of
  its own barrel files are validator-covered and yield no symbols, and those are precisely the
  files §28 and §33 exist to protect.

  **This is a breaking change to the trace surface** for anything parsing `driftCoverage` off
  stderr or out of the MCP trace — the number moves for every uncovered-but-symbol-bearing item.
  Renaming it to `astCoveredItems` instead was considered: that breaks the surface identically,
  so it buys nothing on the axis where it looks cheaper, and it would keep a field that provably
  duplicates the one beside it.

  It survived this long because it was wrong in **both directions at once** on a mixed bundle —
  counting a symbol-free barrel, excluding a symbol-bearing Go file — and the errors partly
  cancelled to a plausible-looking number. Two tests pinned the misnomer rather than the
  behaviour: `drift-unwitnessed-elision.test.ts` asserted `symbolBearingItems: 1` three
  lines below `unwitnessedItems.length: 1`, the trace claiming the item both bore symbols and
  left no witness. Both are corrected.

  **Measured over a corpus frozen at `1e0f71f`** — 290 files, 580 rows, ratio 0.3, both routes,
  16 fields compared per row with the key asserted unique:

  | | |
  |---|---|
  | rows differing | **254 of 580** |
  | fields differing | **`symbolBearingItems` only** |
  | direction | **254 up, 0 down** — it only ever under-counted |
  | rows with `symbolsBefore > 0` beside `symbolBearingItems: 0` | **254 → 0** |
  | `outputSha` | identical on **all 580** |

  The differing buckets name the cause — `tcl`, `c`, `shell`, `perl`, `rust`, `css`, every
  language with no validator — plus **63 rows of `typescript/stdin`**, this project's own language
  on its own second route, where pathless TypeScript gets no validator either (§29).

  The per-item extractor is split out as `extractItemSymbols`, so the count and `symbolsBefore`
  come from **one** pass. Computed as a separate filter it cost a measured **19 ms of 196 ms** on
  an 18-item bundle — every regex run twice over every item, for a reporting field; the split
  brings that to ~6 ms. It is behaviour-preserving by construction rather than by testing: the
  loop body was already a pure function of one item, with 11 writes to the shared set and **zero**
  reads, so a union of per-item sets is the set it used to accumulate.

  **`unwitnessedItems` is not a subset of it**, though its doc comment said “of those”. §33
  widened the unwitnessed rule from validator-covered items to every item — the opposite of a
  subset, and the exact population §33 was written to stop losing.

## [v1.7.2] - 2026-09-01

**The published package no longer ships its own test suite.** No runtime behaviour changes; the
product files are byte-for-byte what 1.7.1 shipped.

### Changed
- **`npm run build` emits `src/` only, via a new `tsconfig.build.json`.** `tsconfig.json` covers
  `src/` *and* `test/` because `npm run typecheck` wants it to — a type error in a test is a real
  error, and that config is what catches a bad generic in a suite vitest runs green. But the
  build shared it, so `tsc` emitted `dist/test/` as well, and `files` ships all of `dist`.

  Measured with `npm pack --dry-run`:

  | | entries | packed | unpacked |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1.7.1 | 508 | 778 KB | 3.08 MB |
  | 1.7.2 | **223** | **496 KB** | **1.65 MB** |

  All 285 removed entries are under `dist/test/`; **nothing was added, and no product file
  changed** — `dist/src/` is the same 210 files at the same paths. Compiled suites were 46% of
  the unpacked package, against 210 entries for the product itself.

  **Only emission narrows.** `npm run typecheck` still runs against `tsconfig.json` and still
  covers the suite — mutation-checked by planting a type error in a test file: `typecheck` reports
  `TS2322`, the build config ignores it. Losing that coverage would have been a worse trade than
  the bytes are worth.

  **`rootDir: "."` is load-bearing and is now pinned by a test.** It is set explicitly in
  `tsconfig.json`, which is the only reason narrowing `include` to `src/**` is safe: unset, `tsc`
  infers the common root of its inputs, which for a src-only build is `src/` — silently relocating
  every output from `dist/src/cli/main.js` to `dist/cli/main.js` and breaking `main`, `types` and
  `bin` in a build that still succeeds. Verified by diffing the emitted file list across the
  change: identical.

  `test/unit/published-package-scope.test.ts` pins the arrangement, including that the build
  script actually *uses* the new config — a config nothing runs is inert, and asserting on the
  file alone would pass in a repository that ignores it.

  The vitest `dist` exclude (audit OX-H3) **stays**, and its comment is corrected rather than
  deleted: `npm run build` no longer produces `dist/test/`, but `tsc -p tsconfig.json` without
  `--noEmit` still does, so the guard is cheaper than remembering that.
## [v1.7.1] - 2026-09-01

**No runtime behaviour changes.** One test file, and the version number needed to carry it.

Cut because v1.7.0 could not absorb it: that tag was already published on GitHub, and the fix
does change the tarball. `tsc -p tsconfig.json` compiles `test/` as well as `src/`, and `files`
ships all of `dist`, so the compiled suite travels with the package — 285 of the tarball's 508
entries. Worth stating because it is easy to assume a test-only change cannot reach consumers
here, and it does.

**v1.7.1 is the first npm release since 1.6.0.** Neither 1.6.1 nor 1.7.0 was published; both
are GitHub releases only. Everything in their notes ships here, and anyone upgrading from 1.6.0
should read all three sections.

### Fixed
- **The stray-suite guard walked a Python virtualenv (audit OX-H3's test, not the fix).**
  `test-collection-scope` skipped `.venv` but not `venv` — and `.gitignore:16` ignores `venv/`,
  which is the name `tokendamper-benchmark/` actually uses. On any checkout where the benchmark
  harness had been set up, the walk descended **68,061 entries** of a virtualenv.

  Measured in the checkout that failed, same walk, only the skip set varied: **298 ms / 68,593
  entries → 3 ms / 530 entries**. Strays: 0 in both arms — it stops walking a dependency tree,
  it does not stop looking.

  The symptom was a 5 s timeout rather than an assertion, which is why it passed in isolation,
  in CI and in a fresh worktree: none of those has a venv. It surfaced only under
  `prepublishOnly`, which is that gate doing its job.

  **It was also a latent false positive**, and that is the half worth keeping: any third-party
  package shipping a bundled `foo.test.js` would have been reported as a stray suite belonging
  to this repository. The cost of the miss was never only time.

  The skip list stays hand-synced with `.gitignore` rather than derived from it, because the
  walk must still see **untracked** files — OX-H3 was a duplicated suite in an untracked
  worktree copy, so anything keyed on tracked files would miss the case the test exists for.
  The drift between the two lists is exactly what this entry is an instance of, and the reason
  is recorded at the site.
## [v1.7.0] - 2026-09-01

**`oxaudit.md` is closed in full** — a second independent audit, closed across two releases.
The last four findings land here, and three of them were decisions rather than defects
(DECISIONS §70).

**Two things change under you, and both are the point rather than side effects:**

- **An exposed Gateway bind with no token now refuses to start.** If you run the Gateway on
  `0.0.0.0` (or any LAN address) without `gatewayToken`, `start()` throws instead of listening.
  That configuration was an unauthenticated relay forwarding request bodies to upstream
  providers. Set a token, bind loopback, or set `allowUnauthenticatedNonLoopback: true` if an
  open relay is genuinely what you want. `tokendamper exec` is unaffected — it binds loopback
  *and* generates a token — and loopback trust (audit C3) is untouched.
- **Plain `tokendamper bench` no longer executes fixture code through `python`.** It reports a
  different quantity under the same field names: `syntaxPassRate` and `passAt1Rate` now come
  from validation, measured **0.6** against the execution-derived **1.0** on the bundled
  fixtures. Pass `--evaluate-quality` for the previous numbers.

**1.6.1 was tagged and released on GitHub but never published to npm.** Everything in its notes
is in this release; if you are coming from 1.6.0, read that section too — it carries Go elision,
the withdrawn `--trace-output`, and four Gateway fixes.

Minor rather than major on this project's standing rule: nothing that worked was removed. The
exposed-bind refusal is the closest call, and it lands here rather than at major because what
stops working is a configuration that was silently unsafe, not a capability.

### Changed
- **`tokendamper bench` no longer executes dataset code (audit OX-M15).**
  `BenchmarkRunner.run` read `config.evaluateQuality !== false`, so quality evaluation
  defaulted **on**, and the evaluator runs each fixture's code and its dataset checks through
  `python -c`. A harness `ARCHITECTURE.md` calls offline and deterministic reached for an
  interpreter because someone typed `bench`, and the only way out was
  `TOKENDAMPER_BENCH_DISABLE_PYTHON`, documented nowhere.

  `--evaluate-quality` now asks for it, command-scoped per DECISIONS §30. Verified on the
  built artifact rather than in-process: plain `bench humaneval --report-json` writes a report
  containing **0** occurrences of `python-subprocess`; with `--evaluate-quality`, **5**.

  **What changes for you:** plain `bench` reports a different quantity under the same field
  names. `syntaxPassRate` and `passAt1Rate` fall back to validation outcomes — measured, 0.6
  against the execution-derived 1.0 on the bundled fixtures. Pass `--evaluate-quality` to get
  the old numbers. The two regression suites that assert on them now request it by name.

- **A non-loopback Gateway bind with no token refuses to start (audit OX-M8).** The token gate
  read `if (this.config.gatewayToken && !isLoopbackPeer(req))` — enforced only *if one was
  configured*. Binding `0.0.0.0` and setting none served an unauthenticated relay that
  forwarded arbitrary request bodies to upstream providers, with no warning. The README already
  described the intended rule; the code implemented "enforced only if provided".

  `start()` now throws, naming the host and the ways out. `allowUnauthenticatedNonLoopback` is
  the explicit opt-in for someone who genuinely wants an open relay — a separate field rather
  than a magic token value, so the intent is legible in a config file.

  Refusing rather than warning, because the configuration this protects is a server nobody is
  watching: stderr reaches the person starting it in a terminal and no one starting it from a
  unit file. Auto-generating a token was considered and is worse in a specific way — startup
  succeeds and every existing client begins failing 401, a subtler break than a named refusal.

  **What changes for you:** an existing exposed-bind config breaks loudly. That is the
  decision, not a side effect. `tokendamper exec` is unaffected — it binds loopback *and*
  generates a token. Loopback trust (audit C3) and the constant-time compare are untouched,
  and both are asserted so a later change cannot buy this guarantee by revoking C3.

- **The Gateway rejects browser-initiated requests (audit OX-M9, and OX-L13 folded in).** A page
  the user visits can issue a **simple** cross-origin `POST` (`text/plain`) to
  `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/v1/chat/completions` with no preflight. It cannot read the response
  and must supply its own credentials, so what it gains is the victim's machine as a relay.

  A request whose `Origin` is present and foreign now gets `403` on every bind; a `Host` naming
  somewhere else gets `403` on a **loopback** bind, which is where DNS rebinding is the threat.
  `localhost`, any `127.x`, `::1` and the configured bind are accepted, so local clients are
  unaffected. The policy runs before `/health` — a check that endpoint sat in front of would be
  a check with a documented way around it.

  **Two corrections to the finding, both from measuring before fixing.** The audit proposed an
  OPTIONS handler with a restrictive CORS policy; measured, the server already answers OPTIONS
  with `405` and no `Access-Control-*` headers, which *is* that policy — and preflight was
  never the gap, since a simple request skips it. And the recorded decision said non-browser
  clients "send neither header": true of `Origin`, false of `Host`, which every HTTP/1.1 client
  must send. The local client contract is preserved by what is accepted, not by absence.

  **`GET /health` now returns `{"status":"ok"}` and nothing else** (audit OX-L13).
  `activeSessions` told an unauthenticated caller how much conversation traffic flows through
  the machine, and `/health` is the one endpoint deployments expose deliberately.

### Documentation
- **`--minimum-confidence` and `--max-debt` documented as inert on the CLI (audit OX-M13).**
  Both are parsed, range-validated and threaded into `optimize()`, and neither can change what
  `tokendamper optimize` emits. Validation confidence is binary (`passed ? 1 : 0`), so the gate
  reads `1 < x` on a passing run and `0 < x` on a failing one where `!validation.passed` has
  already decided; the ledger arm is a literal `1.0` with no ledger, and the CLI supplies none.
  `--max-debt` can enter the rehydration branch, but `attemptAutomatedRehydration` returns on
  its first line without a hasher or ledger — and the CLI supplies neither.

  That last reason is **stronger than the one DECISIONS §64 gave** ("`shouldRehydrate` needs 75
  and the elision term caps at 35"), which explains the *default* threshold — and `--max-debt`
  is precisely the flag that lowers it. Right outcome, argument that does not carry.

  Documented rather than made live because the machinery is real and reachable through the
  exported `optimize()`. Both are live for an embedder passing a `tokenHasher` and/or
  `confidenceLedger`; `--minimum-confidence` is live on the Gateway, which builds a ledger per
  request. `test/unit/cli/inert-dials.test.ts` pins the CLI behaviour as a characterization
  test, so a change making either dial live fails it and forces the README to be rewritten.

## [v1.6.1] - 2026-08-30

**Four languages reduce instead of three, and four Gateway defects that reached provider
traffic are fixed.** This release closes Lane A of `oxaudit.md` and all of Lane B except two
items held open for a decision — a second, independent audit against `79aedef`, unrelated to
`max_audit.md`’s wave structure.

**The one thing that can break a script:** `--trace-output` is now `Unknown argument`, and
`explain` is rejected rather than ignored from `--mode`, `TOKENDAMPER_APP_MODE` and the config
file. Nothing that took effect stops taking effect — neither dial was ever read — but a wrapper
passing `--trace-output stderr` will now exit non-zero. A config file still carrying a
`traceOutput` key keeps loading, and the trace itself has not moved: stderr, as always.

**Numbered as a patch.** Two changes here do alter what the same command emits for the same
input — Go now elides, and `debtScore` reports a measurement rather than a constant pinned at
its clamp — so pin exactly if your tooling depends on byte-stable output or parses `debtScore`
out of the trace.

### Removed
- **`--trace-output` / `TOKENDAMPER_TRACE_OUTPUT`, and the `explain` value of `--mode` /
  `TOKENDAMPER_APP_MODE` (audit OX-H5, DECISIONS §62).** Both were parsed, validated against an
  enum, threaded through the file → env → CLI precedence chain, frozen onto `ResolvedConfig` — and
  read by nothing. `traceOutput` appears at ten sites in `src/`; every one is a write or a type
  declaration. The trace is emitted by a literal `io.stderr.write(...)`, so `--trace-output stdout`
  reported success and changed nothing, and a caller redirecting it to capture a trace in a pipe
  concluded the tool had ignored them. It had. Nothing branched on `explain` at all.

  This is the defect audit H4 already removed three flags for; these two survived that sweep only
  because they sit on `ResolvedConfig` rather than `OptimizationBudget`. Withdrawn on H4's terms:
  **the surfaces go, the model fields stay**, documented as unconsumed, because `ARCHITECTURE.md`
  pins the model as frozen and a field awaiting an implementation is not the same defect as a dial
  that reports success.

  Implementing `--trace-output` would have been two lines. The evidence against it is that the only
  caller in this repository which passed it — `tools/corpus-harness/measure.js`, with
  `--trace-output stderr` — has been reading stderr correctly the whole time *while passing a flag
  that did nothing*. The sole user asked for the default.

  **`--mode` is narrowed by value, not removed.** `--mode bench` rewrites the command, which is a
  live effect; it lives in the parser rather than in anything that reads `appMode`, and that
  distinction is why the flag survives.

  What changes for existing setups: `--trace-output` is now `Unknown argument`, and `explain` is
  rejected rather than ignored from all three surfaces — the rule 1.6.0 set for the
  `TOKENDAMPER_*` enums. Nothing that took effect stops taking effect, because none of it ever did.
  A config file still carrying a `traceOutput` key keeps loading: the key is no longer validated or
  read, and withdrawing a knob must not turn a file that loaded yesterday into a hard error.
  `tools/corpus-harness/measure.js` was updated in the same change, since leaving it would have
  turned the measurement harness into a parse error. **The trace itself has not moved** — stderr,
  as always.

### Added
- **The CLI says when whole files were dropped to meet the budget.** `pruning:topology-pruner`
  removes entire items rather than eliding them, so the file is simply absent from stdout with no
  marker — and a caller piping that into a model cannot notice, because the model will not report
  a file it was never shown. It infers the API and is confidently wrong. Measured on a real
  8-item project at ratio 0.3, two modules vanished silently. The count was already in the trace;
  *which* files, and the fact that it happened, were nowhere a person reading a terminal would see.

  Pruning turns out to be common rather than exceptional: on a five-module fixture it fired at
  **every** ratio from 0.05 to 0.5, because `resolveTokenCeiling` derives the ceiling from the
  bundle, so a gentler ratio still lands below it.

- **`--keep-docstrings` keeps a Python function's docstring when its body is elided (DECISIONS
  §58).** The retention test found 3 of 4 lost answers lived in docstrings -- the *why* of a
  function, not its shape. Off by default, because measured it is a trade: keeping docstrings
  gives back **14.2%** of the saving on real pip code and **21.1%** on doc-heavy source
  (end-to-end 33.4% -> 27.5% on the expense-analyzer project, docstrings preserved 26 -> 51). The
  default path is 576/576 byte-identical; the flag is a runtime option that never touches the
  frozen `OptimizationBudget`, and it is inert on TypeScript/JavaScript, whose doc comments sit
  outside the body.

- **`DriftTracker.extractSymbols` sees Go function and method declarations (DECISIONS §59).**
  Step 1 of the three that widen elision to Go, and **Go is still unelidable after it** — reduction
  stays 0.00%, `trace.languageSupport` still reports Go unsupported, and 574 of 574 corpus rows are
  byte-identical. What it closes is a measurement hole, not a reduction one: a Go file with every
  function deleted but package, import and struct left standing used to score `S_k = 0.0000` with
  `astMeasured: true`, both gates passing and `fallbackUsed: false`, because the only symbols Go
  yielded were `type:` and `import:` ones that survive elision by construction. It now scores
  **0.6667** and the retention gate refuses.

  Signature-preserving body elision still scores 0.0000, which is required rather than a gap — that
  is what region elision does, and if it moved, step 3 would ship as a fallback generator. The
  change is that the gate can now tell those two apart; before, they were the same number.

- **Go has an AST-lite validator, so `.go` items are checked instead of skipped (DECISIONS
  §60).** Step 2 of the three that widen elision to Go, and **Go is still unelidable after it**
  — `regionElisionLanguage` needs the language in `REGION_ELISION_LANGUAGES` as well as a
  validator, and that is step 3. Measured on 80 frozen Go files: on the file route items no
  validator looked at go **80 → 0**, reduction stays **0.00%** in both arms, no new fallbacks,
  and output is **160/160 byte-identical**. Coverage moves; output does not.

  It is a Go lexer rather than a reuse of the TypeScript one, and the difference is measured
  over 9,181 real Go files (100.8 MB): the TypeScript lexer flags **73 (0.80%)**, this one
  flags **1 (0.01%)**, and that one file is the Go compiler's own deliberately-malformed
  testdata. The 72 it disagrees on are raw strings — `` strings.Contains(v, `\`) `` and a
  200-line shell template — because Go's backtick string has no escapes, spans lines, and is
  full of quotes and braces. Same finding as DECISIONS §17, measured for Go.

  A piped `.go` with no `--language` is still uncovered: there is no Go content probe, by the
  same rule as §31. Declare it, or pass `--input-name`.

  **It also exposed a reporting defect, recorded rather than fixed.**
  `DriftCoverage.symbolBearingItems` counts validator-*covered* items, not items bearing symbols.
  Go between §59 and §60 was the first language ever to have symbols without a validator, and that
  made the pair self-contradict: all 80 frozen Go rows reported `symbolsBefore = 3`+ next to
  `symbolBearingItems = 0`. `symbolsBefore` is the honest field. It is a trace field consumers
  parse, so changing it is its own decision — see DECISIONS §60.

- **Go elides. Elision now reduces four languages instead of three (DECISIONS §61).** Step 3 of
  three, and the one that changes output: a Go brace scanner, a `^func` keyword header test, and
  a statement splitter that boundaries on newlines because Go ends statements by semicolon
  insertion rather than by a written `;`.

  Measured on a frozen 80-file Go corpus at target 0.3: **application Go 27.46%** (32 of 40
  reducing) and **stdlib 19.42%** (25 of 40) — against this repo's TypeScript at 21.22% on the
  same engine, so the newest language is also the strongest. §56 projected 23–28% and
  application Go landed at the top of it. **The 287-file main corpus is 574/574
  byte-identical**: every Go path is gated on the language, so TypeScript and Python do not move.

  **`_test.go` is where most of the saving is** — 26.88% against 14.42% for source, with half
  the fallbacks, because Go's table-driven tests put large literal slices inside function bodies.

  Go now reports as supported on `trace.languageSupport`, and the "elision reduces
  TypeScript/JavaScript and Python only" explanation has been corrected wherever it is emitted.

  **Go falls back on 25% of files, and 18 of the 20 are `CONSTRAINT_DIRECTIVE_LOST`** — the
  descriptive-present-tense axis §52 deliberately left open (`// This never happens in practice`,
  `// Should never happen, but we`). §56 expected Go's lower comment density to make that gate
  fire less; measured, it dominates exactly as it does for TypeScript, at the same rate. The
  largest remaining gain on Go is in that gate, not in the scanner.

### Fixed
- **A comment claimed `--target-reduction-ratio` is "nearly as inert — the planner reads it only as
  `> 0`".** False since DECISIONS §48 resolved the ratio into an absolute token ceiling that both
  `pruning:topology-pruner` and `compression:token-hashing` respect, with §50 narrowing the
  adherence gap further via sub-region elision. The README's environment-variable table carried the
  same stale claim. Comments record decisions in this codebase; one recording a *superseded*
  decision argues for undoing the fix.

- **`minimumConfidence` is validated as the probability it is (audit OX-M10).** It reached
  `TokenDamperConfig` through a bare finite-number check, so `TOKENDAMPER_MINIMUM_CONFIDENCE=1.5`
  forced a fallback on **every** run — full output, 0% reduction, permanently, with no diagnostic
  naming the cause, because no confidence the pipeline computes can reach 1.5. Negative values were
  simply meaningless. Out-of-range and unparseable values are now rejected in the message style
  v1.6.0 gave the `TOKENDAMPER_*` enums.

  The audit named only the environment variable. The CLI flag carried the identical
  `Number.isFinite`-and-nothing-else check and the config file was type-checked as `number`, so
  **all three doors** are validated — enumerate the doors, not the one that got reported.

- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`'s pipeline diagram described a pipeline that does not exist (audit OX-M11).**
  It listed execution as "Session Deduplication (TokenHasher) → Delta Compression (Myers Diff) →
  Workspace Topology Pruning". Every clause was wrong: that is not the knapsack order,
  `cleanup:constraint-preservation` was missing from the front of it, `cleanup:session-dedup` is
  not in that plan at all, and it uses the session store rather than `TokenHasher`. The file
  declares itself the canonical frozen reference, so contributors and agents were validating new
  stages against a fiction.

  It now documents all three real plan shapes — `topology_knapsack`, `session_dedup` and
  `pass_through` (which runs zero stages, the case users repeatedly mistake for a bug).
  `test/unit/architecture-doc-accuracy.test.ts` checks the documented stage lists against the
  planner that emits them, so the lists are derived rather than hand-maintained; all four of its
  cases fail against the previous text.

- **`bench/runner.ts` no longer documents a default that was deliberately removed (audit OX-M12).**
  The comment said `token-hashing` "falls back to `new TokenHasher()` internally when none is
  supplied". It did once; that default was removed because a store constructed inside the stage is
  garbage-collected when the stage returns, leaving markers referring to content held by nothing.
  A comment asserting removed behavior is an invitation to "simplify" the runner back into relying
  on it and silently recreate the defect.

- **A directory walk no longer descends into agent worktrees, and orders the same on every OS
  (audit OX-M4, OX-M16).** Both are selection defects, and selection is load-bearing: the
  cache-aware prefix lock pins the first ~1,024 tokens and pinned items bypass the knapsack
  entirely, so which files appear — and in what order — decides which survive (invariants 6, 7).

  - `SKIP_DIRECTORIES` enumerated `.git`, `.next` and `.venv` by name, so `.claude` was missing —
    and `.claude/worktrees/<name>/` holds entire duplicate checkouts. Observed: `tokendamper
    optimize .` ingested this repository's own source twice, once from `src/` and once from a
    stale worktree. Skipping is now by *shape* — any dot-directory — because enumerating names
    never kept up: `.agents`, `.cursor`, `.idea`, `.cache` each arrive as a silent duplicate
    rather than an error. Explicitly naming a file inside one still takes it; the rule governs
    walking only.
  - Paths were built with `path.join` (native separators) and then sorted as native strings, so
    `\` (0x5C) was compared on Windows where `/` (0x2F) was compared elsewhere. Every sibling
    whose name sorts between them — every digit and every capital letter — ordered differently
    per platform: `src/a.ts` precedes `srcZ/a.ts` on POSIX because `/` < `Z`, and follows it on
    Windows because `Z` < `\`. The same directory produced two different bundles. Sorting now
    runs on separator-normalized keys; the emitted paths stay native, since they are what the
    envelope prints and what the caller has to be able to open.

  **OX-L4 (symlinks skipped in a walk, followed when named) is recorded at its site, not fixed.**
  The fix is small, but it could not be exercised where it was written — creating a symlink needs
  elevation or Developer Mode on Windows and returned `EPERM` — and shipping an unverified change
  to the code that decides which files reach the pipeline is the trade this project keeps
  declining. Skipping is the safe direction: a file is omitted, never corrupted.

- **The multi-file route stops accepting flags it then drops (audit OX-M2, OX-M3, OX-M14).**
  `SUPPORTED_FLAGS` exists so an inapplicable flag is a parse error naming where it *does* apply
  (DECISIONS §30). These got past it by being genuinely valid on `optimize` — just not on the
  branch a directory or a second path takes.

  - `--diff` is now rendered on a multi-file run. It was honored on the single-file path and
    silently ignored here, so asking for a terminal diff over a directory produced nothing.
    `renderTerminalDiff` already accepts a whole `ContextBundle`, so there was no missing capability
    — only a missing call.
  - `--language` is now **refused** when a directory or more than one path is ingested, rather than
    stamped onto every file. It exists for input with no filename to classify by; a walk has one
    filename per file, so a blanket declaration can only overwrite a correct answer with a single
    wrong one, and declaration outranks extension by design. The harm is bigger than a mislabel:
    measured on a three-file tree, `--language python` moved `languageSupport` from "1 unsupported
    (json)" to **"3 supported, 0 unsupported"**, left `astCoverage` reading `unchecked: 0` because
    the Python validator genuinely did look at the JSON, and **fell the whole run back** — a
    coverage report that lies with a guaranteed 0% behind it. Single-file and stdin are unchanged.
  - The dropped-files warning no longer advises in both directions at once. It read *"Raise
    `--target-reduction-ratio`'s budget (a lower ratio prunes less)"* — the verb and the
    parenthesis disagreed, and a reader following the verb did the opposite of what was meant.

  **`--input-name` was reported alongside these and is not a defect.** `parseArguments` already
  throws `--input-name applies to stdin input only` for any non-`-` input path, so it never silently
  no-oped on a directory. Verified rather than assumed, and pinned so it stays that way.

- **`tokendamper exec` exits with the code its child exited with (audit OX-H1).** `runExecCommand`
  always resolved the real code. `runCli` threw it away: the `exec` branch fired the promise,
  attached a `.catch`, and returned a synchronous `0` that had already been assigned to
  `process.exitCode` before the child finished. The process stayed alive only because the spawned
  child holds the inherited stdio, so the code did arrive — into nothing. `tokendamper exec --
  aider … && next-step` therefore ran `next-step` after a failed tool, and any CI step wrapping a
  build in `exec` reported green regardless. Invariant 10 at the process boundary.

  `runCli` now returns `number | Promise<number>` — a union rather than a blanket `async`, because
  `optimize`, `bench` and `mcp` have their code immediately and every existing caller reads the
  result directly. `await` handles both.

  **The larger half of this fix was not in `exec` at all.** `package.json`'s `bin` points at
  `dist/src/cli/main.js`, so the shipped command runs the `require.main === module` block at the
  foot of the file — not the exported `main()` that tests and the wrapper call. The two had drifted
  into separate copies of the same assignment, and the copy at the foot carried a
  `typeof exitCode === 'number'` guard that was harmless dead code while `runCli` always returned a
  number. The moment `exec` returned a promise it became a silent drop: **the installed binary
  would have gone on exiting 0 with the entire suite green behind it.** The block now delegates to
  `main()`, and `test/integration/cli-exec-exit-code.test.ts` pins the delegation as well as the
  codes, because the defect was duplication rather than any particular line.

  Verified end to end on the built binary, not only through `runCli`: requested 0/3/42 give exit
  0/3/42, an unresolvable command gives 1, and `optimize` still exits 0.

- **`npm test` no longer collects suites belonging to other checkouts (audit OX-H3).** The
  repository had no vitest config, so collection used vitest's default `include` and walked the
  whole tree from the root. Agent worktrees live under `.claude/worktrees/<name>/` and each is a
  *full* checkout, `test/` included — so every stale worktree silently contributed a second, older
  copy of the entire suite. Measured: the canonical suite is **78 files / 723 tests**; the audit's
  run in a tree holding one stale worktree reported **155 / 1410**, almost exactly double, with the
  extra half two commits behind `main`.

  The cost is not wall-clock. A stale copy passes against its own frozen source, so a green run
  says nothing about the tree being edited — invariant 10 (a check that never looked reads exactly
  like a check that passed) arriving through the test runner itself. CI was never affected, because
  a fresh checkout has no `.claude/`, so "the suite" meant two different things locally and
  remotely.

  `vitest.config.ts` now anchors `include` to `test/**/*.test.ts` and restates `node_modules`,
  `dist` and `.claude` in `exclude` — restated because specifying `exclude` *replaces* vitest's
  default rather than extending it, and `dist` is not hypothetical: `tsc -p tsconfig.json` compiles
  `test/` as well as `src/`, so any build leaves a second copy of every suite in `dist/test/`.
  `globals: true` is set to make `tsconfig.json`'s existing `types: ["node", "vitest/globals"]`
  declaration true rather than decorative — no test relies on it today, all 78 import from
  `'vitest'` explicitly.

  `test/unit/test-collection-scope.test.ts` pins it, and pins the half that an anchored `include`
  puts at risk: that every suite in the repo really does live under `test/`, so the anchor is not
  hiding one. The guard was mutation-checked rather than assumed — widening the include, dropping
  `.claude` from exclude, deleting the config, and planting a suite outside `test/` each fail it.
  `npm run lint` needed no equivalent guard; it is already path-scoped as `eslint src test`.

- **The `oxaudit.md` LOW table, closed against its own list (DECISIONS §69).** Six fixed, five
  recorded at their sites with the reason, three already "no action" in the audit itself.

  - **L6** — the per-session seen-hash cap was a bare `1000` inside `capSeenBlockHashes` while every
    neighbouring bound was configurable. Now `GatewayConfig.maxSeenBlockHashesPerSession`, same
    default.
  - **L7** — the MCP buffer-overflow check ran *before* `processBuffer` and then cleared the whole
    buffer, so a chunk carrying complete requests followed by one oversized partial discarded the
    complete ones too. Draining first leaves only the un-terminated remainder for the limit to
    judge.
  - **L9** — the bench loader's `limits` merge could never fire (`ResolvedConfig` has no such
    field, which is why it needed two `as unknown as Record<string, unknown>` casts). Deleting it
    also removed an `as unknown as ResolvedConfig` that was disabling type checking for every other
    key in that literal.
  - **L10** — dataset routing matched `includes('humaneval')` *before* checking for a real path, so
    `./fixtures/humaneval-comparison-2026.jsonl` was silently answered with the bundled dataset.
    Now exact name, then path, then substring as a last resort.
  - **L12** — `package.json` and `src/version.ts` are hand-synced; a test now pins them equal.
  - **L19** — `.gitignore` was the full GitHub Python template (245 lines, ~111 entries, Django
    through pdm) with the dozen working entries buried at the bottom. Now 44 lines and 25 entries,
    keeping a real Python block for `tokendamper-benchmark/`. Verified by diffing
    `git status --porcelain` across the change: nothing became newly visible.

  **Not fixed, and why:** **L1** (`expectedSavings: 0.45` is unconsumed and not a measurement — the
  frozen-model precedent H4 set and OX-H5 followed), **L8** (the MCP shutdown flush race — the fix
  depends on stream state the file does not control and getting it wrong hangs `mcp` on Ctrl+C,
  which this suite cannot exercise), **L13** (`/health` exposing `sessionCount` is M8/M9's question,
  and answering it twice is how two answers drift), **L17** and **L18** (both need a new
  devDependency, which is not a call to make unasked on a LOW finding).

- **Pricing a candidate region no longer registers it with the block store (audit OX-M5, DECISIONS
  §68).** `trimRegionsToCeiling` renders a marker for **every** candidate span in order to price it
  — correctly, since the marker is variable-length and self-describing and a saving estimated
  without it would overstate every region. But the renderer it was handed also called
  `hasher.registerBlock(...)`, so every span the ceiling considered and then *discarded* was written
  into the store anyway.

  Measured on a 12-region file: **12 blocks registered against 5 actually emitted** at target 0.1,
  and 12 against 3 at 0.05. The store held one block per candidate rather than per elision, so
  memory grew with how much the scanner found rather than with how much was removed, and
  `hasHash` / `expandBlockHash` answered for placeholders present in no output. Invisible on the
  CLI, which supplies no hasher; it matters on **MCP**, where the server is long-lived and the
  hasher *is* the reversibility store.

  The binding constraint was that pricing and emission must render **identical bytes**, or the
  ceiling is computed against a different string from the one written and
  `--target-reduction-ratio` adherence shifts. Corpus A/B over 289 files / 578 rows frozen at
  `48ac6c8`: **zero rows differ on any of ten compared fields**, with 101 rows genuinely reducing —
  so the corpus contains the shape and the result is not vacuous. The A/B proves output-neutrality;
  it cannot see the leak itself, because CLI routes supply no hasher. That is what the new unit test
  is for.

- **Within-payload deduplication works on the first turn (audit OX-M1, DECISIONS §67).** It was
  treated as a side condition of cross-turn matching: the dedup branch was gated on
  `previousBlockHashes.has(hash)` and the stage returned early unless that set was non-empty, so a
  first turn carrying the same block three times went out whole. The README's savings table said
  "the same block repeated **within one payload** → saves" with no qualifier; it was true from turn
  two.

  The gate was doing no safety work there. `recoverable: true` means an intact copy survives in the
  *same outbound payload*, which rule 3 guarantees by preserving the first occurrence — a claim
  checkable without knowing anything about earlier turns. `previousBlockHashes` answers a different
  question (*is this content old?*) and was deciding something it does not bear on.

  **DECISIONS §16/§41 are untouched.** A **sole** copy elided across turns is still elided with
  `recoverable: false`, still scored in full by `DriftTracker`, and still fails the gate — so the
  ordinary conversational shape still saves 0 bytes and still falls back, which is the number the
  README leads with.

  Measured over real sockets with a block repeated three times: turn 1 went from **8,459 sent /
  8,459 forwarded** to a real saving, while a turn 1 of all-distinct blocks still saves nothing —
  the control that keeps "turn 1 saves now" from meaning "turn 1 always saves".

- **The Gateway no longer truncates streaming responses after 30 seconds (audit OX-H2, DECISIONS
  §66).** `forwardUpstreamRequest` armed `AbortSignal.timeout(30000)` and handed it to `fetch` —
  and a fetch signal does not stop applying when the promise resolves: **it governs the response
  body stream too.** For `"stream": true` payloads the body reader rejected ~30 s in and the pump
  destroyed the client response, truncating the answer mid-generation. LLM completions routinely
  run longer than that, so this broke precisely the traffic the Gateway intercepts by default, and
  from the client's side it was indistinguishable from the model stopping.

  The budget is now time-to-first-byte and is disarmed in a `finally` the moment `fetch` settles.
  An owned `AbortController` replaces `AbortSignal.timeout` because only a controller you own can
  be left permanently *un*-fired; the 504 mapping survives by aborting with a `TimeoutError`
  `DOMException`, which is the reason `AbortSignal.timeout` produced.

  **Client-hangup abort is unchanged and asserted.** The caller-disconnect signal stays combined
  into the fetch signal, so a client that walks away still aborts the upstream request — the half a
  careless timeout fix removes. That test was mutation-checked, and it needed a second pass: the
  first version sampled the upstream's state after the helper had already stopped the server, which
  closes the upstream socket anyway, so it would have passed either way.

  `upstreamTtfbTimeoutMs` is a new `GatewayConfig` field defaulting to 30000. It is also what makes
  the defect testable: catching a 30-second bug previously required a 30-second upstream, which is
  why no test caught it. The suite now runs against a real socket in about a second.

  Measured against a real upstream at a 120 ms budget with a ~300 ms body: truncated mid-stream
  before, full body after. A 40 ms budget against a ~400 ms body likewise. Slow *headers* still
  return 504, unchanged.

- **One `content: null` message no longer zeroes the whole request's Gateway saving (audit OX-H4,
  DECISIONS §65).** Egress splices replacements into the caller's raw bytes rather than
  re-serializing (invariant 9), and located each message by searching for `JSON.stringify(text)` —
  where `text` came from `flattenMessageContent`, which sends every **non-string** content through
  `JSON.stringify`. For `content: null` that produced the four-character string `null`, so the
  search string was `"null"` *with quotes*, absent where the body holds a bare `null`.
  `spliceIntoRawBody` returns `undefined` on the **first** miss, so one unmatchable message
  discarded the replacements for every other message in the payload.

  `content: null` is the standard OpenAI shape for an assistant turn that calls a tool, so
  essentially every agentic OpenAI conversation carried one. Measured on a three-times-repeated
  block the Gateway does save on: with such a message present, **8,685 bytes sent and 8,685
  forwarded** — the entire saving gone. Array (multimodal) content failed identically at
  **8,530 / 8,530**, which is why this is a structural span scan rather than the `null`
  special-case the audit offered as an alternative: that would have fixed one shape and left the
  other. Both share a cause — `JSON.stringify` of a *parsed* value is not the caller's bytes, and
  a pretty-printed body defeats the search even for plain strings.

  `scanContentSpans` now walks the raw body and returns each spliceable slot's `[start, end)` span,
  and `spliceBySpans` overwrites those ranges directly. A span is where the value *is*, so it is
  correct for every content shape, and repeated blocks need no forward cursor to disambiguate — the
  cursor requirement survives by becoming unnecessary rather than by being dropped.

  **The old value search is kept as a fallback**, so a payload the scanner declines behaves exactly
  as before and this change can only add savings. **Declining remains the failure direction:** the
  scanner refuses a non-object root, absent or non-array `messages`, a message with no `content`
  key, a truncated body, or a missing expected `system`, and the splice refuses when spans do not
  ascend across the entries it replaces.

  Invariant 8 is untouched — the Gateway still plans only `cleanup:session-dedup`, and a sole
  cross-turn copy is still refused. What this recovers is the *within-payload* saving on payloads
  that happen to carry a non-string content.

- **`debtScore` reported 35.00 on every file that reduced, and now measures something (audit
  OX-M7, DECISIONS §64).** `computeDebtBreakdown` added `metadata.originalBytes` to `elidedBytes`
  for any item flagged `elided`. But `originalBytes` is the item's **entire** pre-transform length
  and `elided` is a boolean on the whole item, so an item that lost 5% of its bytes contributed
  100% of its size to the numerator. On the CLI a single file is a single-item bundle, which makes
  `elidedBytes === totalBytes` whenever anything is elided at all — the ratio was 1.0 by
  construction, and `Math.min(1.0, …)` in `calculateDebt` was quietly clamping a value with no
  business exceeding 1.

  Measured over a corpus frozen at `8b447ce` — 289 files, 578 rows, ratio 0.3 — **317 of the 317
  rows carrying any debt scored exactly 35.00**, the `weightElisionRatio * 100` ceiling, whether
  the file lost 4.7% or 66.8%. After the fix (bytes actually removed, `originalBytes -
  content.length`): **0 of 317** at the ceiling, distribution 1.31 → 34.99, and over the 101
  reducing rows the implied ratio tracks the measured byte cut with **correlation 1.0000**.

  **No output moved.** Per-row across 578 rows the only field that changed is `debtScore` —
  `outputSha`, `byteIdentical`, `tokenBefore`, `tokenAfter`, `reduction`, `fallbackUsed`,
  `driftScore`, `planMode` and `stageCount` are identical. Debt gates nothing on the CLI, because
  `shouldRehydrate` needs 75 and the elision term alone caps at 35 — so `--max-debt` still cannot
  trip on a CLI run. It is now a real number, not yet a live gate.

  The audit described this as a denominator mixing pre- and post-transform sizes. That is not what
  happened — every stage setting `elided` also sets `originalBytes`, so the denominator was already
  clean. The numerator was the defect, and it was saturated rather than skewed.

- **An empty rehydration-candidate set no longer means "restore everything" (audit OX-M6,
  DECISIONS §64).** `attemptAutomatedRehydration` guarded with `candidates && candidates.size > 0
  && !candidates.has(item.id)`. The `size > 0` clause is there for the *missing* ledger case; it
  also swallowed the case where a ledger exists and reports **zero** items below the confidence
  threshold, turning "nothing needs restoring" into "restore every elision in the bundle".

  None of the three bundled entry points reaches it — the CLI supplies neither hasher nor ledger,
  MCP and `bench` supply a hasher but no ledger, and the Gateway supplies a ledger but no hasher
  and plans only `cleanup:session-dedup`. It is reachable through the **public API**: `optimize` is
  exported, and an embedder passing both a `tokenHasher` and a `confidenceLedger` lands on it.
  Reproduced there, a 1,481-byte item came back at exactly 1,481 bytes with every elision undone,
  and `debtScore` recomputed to 0 on the restored bundle so the trace reported no debt either.

  The corpus arm for this change differs on **0 of 578 rows**, which is what the structure predicts
  and is *not* evidence of correctness — the harness runs CLI routes, which supply no ledger, so it
  cannot see the shape. The test carries two controls for the same reason: the first version passed
  against the unfixed code, because the default `maxDebtThreshold` of 75 is unreachable on turn 1
  and the branch it claimed to exercise never ran.

- **Content hashing no longer collapses `undefined` onto `null`** (DECISIONS §63). The
  serialization fallback in `stableSerialize` turned an explicit `undefined` into `null`'s
  bytes, so two different values shared one hash. No live constructor reaches the branch —
  which is why it sat unnoticed — and no hash of any real object changes.
- **The content-classifier's extension test reads the basename, not the whole path**
  (DECISIONS §63). A dotted directory (`my.dir/file`) used to leak directory text into the
  extension match. Measured before changing anything: every possible leak already fell through
  to the content probes exactly as an absent extension would, so **no classification changes**;
  the new tests pin the dotted-directory cases so a future edit cannot make the leak reachable
  silently.

### Documentation
- **Two LOW findings recorded at their sites rather than fixed** (DECISIONS §63). The `h → c`
  language alias stays: removing it would make `--language h` an error while `foo.h` stayed
  accepted, which is the two-routes drift the alias table exists to prevent. Git path matching
  stays case-sensitive: case-folding one side would make topology scores depend on the
  platform's filesystem semantics, and determinism is invariant 1; the effect of the open case
  is a lower score, never a wrong output byte.

## [v1.6.0] - 2026-08-16

**Two defects that reached provider traffic, and an audit closed in full.** `max_audit.md` had
been declared closed twice while findings were open; this release ships the work that actually
closed it, plus a defect found by pointing an MCP client at this repository's own source.

**The one thing that can break a startup:** an unrecognized `TOKENDAMPER_*` enum value is now a
hard error instead of being silently ignored. Nothing that worked stops working — the setting
never took effect — but a stale or typo'd `TOKENDAMPER_LOG_LEVEL=verbose` that used to fall back
to the default now fails at startup. See the L1 entry below.

Minor rather than major on this project's standing rule: nothing removed, but the same command
over the same input emits different bytes. Minor rather than patch for the same reason.

### Fixed
- **A file that documents the block-hash placeholder format is no longer mistaken for a corrupted
  one — DECISIONS §57.** `detectCorruptedPlaceholders` scanned for `<BLOCK_HASH:([^>]+)>`, matching
  any text up to the next `>`. This repository's own `src/core/elision/regions.ts` contains the
  line *fixed width of `` `<BLOCK_HASH:` `` + 64 hex + `` `>` ``*, so the scan captured
  `` ` + 64 hex + ` `` as a hash, found it absent from the store, and failed the whole run.

  | | before | after |
  |---|---|---|
  | `regions.ts` over MCP | 0.00%, fallback | **32.00%** |
  | `token-hasher.ts` over MCP | fallback | **35.28%** |

  **22 files in this repo** carry a `<BLOCK_HASH:…>`-shaped string — `ARCHITECTURE.md` and
  `CHANGELOG.md` among them — and every one was unoptimizable over MCP. The capture now requires
  `[a-f0-9]{12,64}`, matching `ELISION_MARKER_PATTERN` beside it; a genuine placeholder absent
  from the store is still reported, which the tests pin as a negative control.

  **Only MCP was affected, and that is why nothing caught it.** The check returns early without a
  `TokenHasher` and the CLI supplies none, so the corpus harness — which drives the CLI — could
  not reach the gate. **576 of 576 corpus rows are byte-identical**, and here that means the
  instrument never ran the check rather than that the change is inert.

- **The Gateway forwards the caller's bytes instead of a re-encoding of them — audit M7, the last
  open finding (DECISIONS §54).** When an elision fired, the proxy rebuilt the request with
  `JSON.stringify`, which rewrote fields it had never touched. Measured on one payload:

  | client sent | provider received |
  |---|---|
  | `"temperature": 1.0` | `"temperature":1` |
  | `"top_p": 1e3` | `"top_p":1000` |
  | `"seed": 12345678901234567890` | `"seed":12345678901234567000` |

  The first two are cosmetic. **The third is a different number** — an integer past 2^53 does not
  survive `JSON.parse` → `JSON.stringify` — so a provider was asked for a seed the caller never
  chose. Duplicate keys collapsed the same way. Elided content is now spliced into the original
  bytes and everything else is left alone; where the caller's escaping differs from ours the
  splice declines and the request is forwarded unchanged, because a lost saving costs tokens and
  a corrupted field costs correctness.

- **A forwarded body can no longer be larger than the one that arrived.** M7's third consequence;
  nothing had ever asserted it.

- **A Python function whose body starts after a blank line is optimizable again — audit L7
  (DECISIONS §55).** `scanPythonDefBodies` read the body indent off `def` + 1 without checking
  whether that line was blank; `indentOf('')` is 0, so the region began at column 0, the marker
  inherited column 0, and `PythonValidator` rejected it. The audit rated this "fails safe (skip)"
  — measured, it costs the whole file, because a one-region file has nothing else to elide:

  | file | in | out |
  |---|---|---|
  | no blank line after `def` | 434 B | **96 B** (77.9%) |
  | blank line after `def` | 436 B | 436 B (0%, fallback) |

  **576 of 576 corpus rows are byte-identical**, because 0 of 45 Python corpus files have a blank
  line in that position. The instrument is blind to this one, which is §52's corpus-bias caveat
  with the sign reversed.

- **An unrecognized `TOKENDAMPER_*` enum value is rejected instead of silently ignored — audit
  L1.** `TOKENDAMPER_PLANNER_MODE=session_dedup` was discarded and the default used, while
  `--planner-mode session_dedup` threw; `session_dedup` is a real `OptimizationMode`, so nothing
  told the user their setting had not applied. All four enum variables now reject through one
  helper, naming the accepted values. Accepted sets are unchanged.

- **The TypeScript validator counts a line continuation as a line — audit L8.** Both escape sites
  advanced two characters without asking whether the skipped one was a newline, so every reported
  position after a `\`-newline read one line short.

### Changed
- **Three dead Gateway metric fields removed (M7 residue).** `GatewayOptimizationOutcome` still
  computed `rawTokens`/`optimizedTokens`/`tokensSaved` from `summary.tokenEstimate` after
  `wireTokenMetrics` replaced them at both call sites. The two disagree by design — 48.5% against
  47.1% on the same payload — and a field that looks authoritative next to the one that replaced
  it is how a closed finding comes back.

- **Three LOW findings are recorded rather than changed, with the reason at the site (DECISIONS
  §55).** L4 (`contentHash` chaining — unreachable; the audit's premise that it was ever a
  content-only hash does not hold), L5 (`getOverallConfidence` returns the minimum — correct for
  a safety gate; the doc comment was what was wrong), L9 (a 12-hex prefix is ample for provenance
  and birthday-bound for identity — not widened, because `TokenHasher.resolve` already treats an
  ambiguous prefix as unresolvable). L6's "Branch & Bound" comment named a search the code does
  not perform and now names the 1/2-approximation guard it is.

- **Gateway savings measure the bytes forwarded, not the bundle render (M7).** `rawTokens` and
  `optimizedTokens` came from `summary.tokenEstimate`, a property of items joined for a human or
  a model rather than the JSON a provider bills. Reported against measured on the same payload:
  **48.5% claimed against 47.1% actual**, now **46.3% against 46.5%**. Still counted in tokens
  through the one estimator — a saving in bytes compared against a budget in tokens is the
  two-estimator defect DECISIONS §19 exists to prevent.

## [v1.5.0] - 2026-08-12

**The gate stops refusing a file for its own commentary.** `CONSTRAINT_DIRECTIVE_LOST` accounted
for **29 of 29** code-bucket fallbacks (§51), and roughly twelve of those were a codebase
narrating its own history — *"has always read these two"*, *"could never have worked"* — not
instructing anyone. Four files that produced nothing now reduce, with 572 of 576 corpus rows
byte-identical and no regressions.

**This release also ends the version-reservation problem (DECISIONS §53).** v1.5.0 was held for
"Granular Sub-Query Re-hydration", and unlike the previous three collisions that release is
perfectly *buildable* — it simply had not been built, so §49's rule ("preconditions measured
false → no number") did not cover it. The general rule replaces it: **the roadmap reserves no
version numbers at all; a number is a fact about what shipped, assigned at ship time.** Four
reservations in four releases were wrong, each for a different reason, which is enough evidence
that predicting the order work finishes is not something this project should encode in a number.

Minor rather than patch, consistent with v1.3.0 and v1.4.0: nothing removed, but the same command
over the same input emits different bytes on 4 of 576 corpus rows.

### Changed
- **A narrative use of `never`/`always` in a comment is no longer a constraint directive
  (DECISIONS §52).** The constraint gate accounts for **29 of 29** code-bucket fallbacks on the
  frozen corpus, and roughly twelve of those were sentences like *"the MCP branch has always read
  these two"* or *"could never have worked"* — a codebase narrating its own history, not
  instructing anyone. §42 scoped this gate by region (a comment, not an expression); this scopes
  it by mood within that region.

  Narrowed in the safe direction three ways: only `never`/`always` (so *"must have been called"*
  is untouched), only provable perfect/past constructions (so *"is always"* keeps firing), and
  only when *every* keyword in the segment is narrative.

  **Per-row over 576 corpus rows: 572 byte-identical, 4 fallbacks fixed, 0 new, 0 files that
  stopped reducing, and no change to any row that was already reducing.** TypeScript file route
  39 → 43 reducing, 16 → 12 fallbacks.

  **The gain is not portable, and the caveat is the point.** All four recovered files are this
  repository's own source, which M11 measured as 32.8% comment prose written in a
  what-used-to-be-true style. Python gained nothing. The 6pp on the TypeScript bucket is the
  corpus-bias trap `CLAUDE.md` warns about, appearing as a favourable number — the harder
  direction to notice.

## [v1.4.0] - 2026-08-12

**The target adheres.** v1.3.0 made `--target-reduction-ratio` bind and recorded that adherence
was partial for a structural reason: elision's smallest unit was a whole function body, and files
typically have one dominant region. This divides the region into its statements, which takes the
population of files overshooting past 50% from **34 rows to 18** with **zero regressions** —
no new fallbacks, no file that stopped reducing.

**Numbered 1.4.0, and the roadmap's reservation on that number was released** rather than moved,
per the rule adopted in §49: a release whose preconditions are measured false holds no version
number. "AST Code Folding & Cache Alignment" is now unnumbered — its Fast-mode half is already
shipped in `elision/regions.ts`, and its cache-alignment half needs a caller-supplied
`cl100k_base` encoder before 1,024-token quantization means anything. This is the third time a
reservation has collided with real work; releasing the number is what stops it recurring.

A minor rather than a patch, for the same reason as v1.3.0: nothing is removed, but the same
command over the same input emits different bytes on 54 of 576 corpus rows.

### Changed
- **Elision divides a region into its statements when a ceiling is set (DECISIONS §50).** The
  smallest thing the stage could remove was a whole function body, which is what made
  `--target-reduction-ratio` overshoot: files typically have one dominant region — 58%, 61%, 83%
  measured — and a body cannot be taken in part. `splitRegionIntoStatements` divides at depth-0
  boundaries only, so every candidate is bracket- and quote-balanced and removing one cannot cut
  a statement in half.

  **Per-row A/B over one frozen corpus, 576 rows, both routes, target 0.3 — no regressions:**

  | | baseline | after |
  |---|---|---|
  | rows above 50% achieved | 34 | **18** |
  | rows reducing | 95 | **99** |
  | new fallbacks | — | **0** |
  | rows that stopped reducing | — | **0** |
  | moved closer to target / further | — | **39 / 11** |

  522 of 576 rows are byte-identical; every changed row is TypeScript or Python under a ceiling.
  Subdivision is confined to the ceiling path, so a run with no target behaves exactly as before.

  **A division that would throw most of its region away is refused**, because the marker floor
  drops short statements and the caller would lose the whole region as an option — measured at
  38.9% → 6.6% on one file before the guard. The threshold was swept rather than chosen; §50
  carries the table, including the setting that scores better on overshoot and costs two working
  files, and why that trade was not taken.

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-08-12

**The flag that did nothing now does what it says.** `--target-reduction-ratio` is the flag every
document and example uses, and until this release it was an on/off switch: any value produced
byte-identical output, and compression ran to exhaustion rather than to the requested figure.

**Numbered 1.3.0, and the roadmap's reservation on that number was released rather than worked
around.** `ROADMAP.md` had v1.3.0 reserved for "Context Selection Quality & Redundancy
Elimination", whose two headline deliverables were both measured unbuildable — BM25 has no query
source anywhere in `src/`, and MMR found 0 of 1,486 real pairs above its threshold. A release that
cannot be built should not hold a version number while a shipped behavioural change waits behind
it; that section is now unnumbered and gated on its preconditions instead. The same collision
happened once before, when v1.2.0 took the number this document had reserved for the same
release — resolving it by renumbering the chain twice is what made it recur (DECISIONS §49).

A minor rather than a patch: nothing is removed, but the same command over the same input emits
different bytes, and `Changed` is where that belongs.

### Changed
- **`--target-reduction-ratio` is a real target — audit H4's deferred half (DECISIONS §48).**
  It was an on/off switch: the planner read it as `> 0` and nothing else read it, so `0.01` and
  `0.99` produced byte-identical output. `resolveTokenCeiling` now converts the ratio into an
  absolute token ceiling, `pruning:topology-pruner` gates on that ceiling instead of
  `maxInputTokens` (it used to bypass itself entirely when only a ratio was set), and
  `compression:token-hashing` stops once the ceiling is met instead of eliding everything it can.

  **Corpus aggregates fall by design.** The harness measures at ratio 0.3, so runs that used to
  overshoot to 44–69% now stop near 30%: python file 23.14% → 20.26%, typescript file 23.03% →
  17.57% — while fallbacks *fell* (python 14 → 13) and reduced counts *rose*, because less
  aggressive elision survives validation more often. Compare per-file adherence, not the mean.

  **Adherence is partial and the limit is structural.** Elision's smallest unit is one region and
  files typically have one dominant region (58%, 61%, 83% measured). At target 30%, 21 of 66
  reducing files landed in 25–35% and 23 still exceeded 50%. Sub-region elision is what would
  close that; it is not attempted here.

### Documentation
- **Audit finding M7 is reinstated as open, having been silently dropped.** No behaviour changed;
  what changed is that the documents stop saying every audit item is closed.
  `docs/audit-remediation-status.md` §6 records the finding, its three consequences re-verified
  against source at `5c7919b`, and why the re-serialization half is not a metrics fix. M7 was
  gated in `ROADMAP.md` behind *"only if question B keeps the Gateway"*; question B was answered
  in DECISIONS §41 and nothing carried M7 across the answer, so it entered no wave table and
  read as done. **An item that is in no table reads exactly like a check that never ran.**

- **The measured baseline was re-taken rather than annotated** (status doc §2): 288 files / 576
  rows at `5c7919b`, clean tree, both routes, target 0.3 — python file **20.26%**, python stdin
  **19.78%**, typescript file **17.57%**, everything else 0.00%. The previous table was pre-§48
  *and* over a different corpus (297 files: typescript 60 → 62, prose 29 → 18 after M11), so it
  was stale twice over while being labelled "the numbers to compare against".

- **Stale gates cleared across `ROADMAP.md`.** Its Version Summary table was a full renumbering
  behind the chain at the top of the same document, still listing v1.1.1–v1.1.3 as "Next —
  blocking" after all three shipped inside v1.2.0. v1.5.0 was marked blocked on M5b, which
  shipped in Wave 2; Milestone 8 blocked on question A, answered by §43; Milestone 9 pending C1
  and H6, both shipped; v1.4.0's `cache_control` blocked on H5, whose actual remaining
  precondition is tokenizer exactness. Each is now marked with what replaced it, not deleted.

- **`README.md`'s Phase 1c table is labelled as pre-§48.** Its 22.73% / 19.47% were measured at
  target 0.3 before that ratio bound; the same corpora now read 20.26% / 17.57% with fewer
  fallbacks.

### Removed
- **The `format` script, `prettier`, `eslint-config-prettier`, `.prettierrc.cjs` and
  `.prettierignore` (DECISIONS §49).** `npm run format` has never passed and nothing has ever
  invoked it: CI runs typecheck, lint, build and test, and so does `prepublishOnly`. Measured
  before removing it, `prettier --check .` failed on **148 files** — every markdown document and
  all 57 TypeScript sources — for two independent reasons: prettier defaults to
  `endOfLine: "lf"` against a CRLF working tree, and the real formatting drift underneath that is
  ~5,118 lines in `src/` plus ~1,900 in the docs.

  Making it pass would have rewritten the whole repository, including the in-source commentary
  that is 32.8% of `src/` and is maintained next to the code it explains. This is audit H4's
  principle applied to a dev script rather than a CLI flag: **a check that has never run is not a
  check, and leaving it red teaches everyone to ignore the one instrument that is red for a
  reason.** `eslint` remains the enforced style gate and is green without
  `eslint-config-prettier`, which existed only to defer to a formatter that is no longer here.

### Fixed
- **`package-lock.json` carried `"license": "MIT"` and `"version": "1.1.0"`.** Audit M3 corrected
  the license in `package.json` and the lockfile mirror was never regenerated, so a file in the
  repository still asserted the pre-M3 license. Not a published claim — npm reads `package.json` —
  but M3 was about a stale copy of exactly this fact, and this was the last one.

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-08-11

**The audit remediation release.** 78 commits beyond `v1.1.0`, closing every finding in
`max_audit.md` and the architectural work that followed from it. `docs/audit-remediation-status.md`
is the index; `DECISIONS.md` §36–§47 carries the reasoning.

**Numbered 1.2.0 rather than 1.1.1**, for two reasons. The roadmap planned the remediation as
three releases — v1.1.1 "Green Tree & Correct Metadata", v1.1.2 "Data Loss & Corruption",
v1.1.3 "Honest Instruments" — and this ships all three plus the Scope Decision Gate answers
(H2, M1, M11) and Phase 1c. And it removes command-line surface, which a patch release is not
permitted to do.

### ⚠ Breaking

- **Three CLI flags removed**, along with their environment variables: `--risk-tolerance`
  (`TOKENDAMPER_RISK_TOLERANCE`), `--max-output-tokens` (`TOKENDAMPER_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`) and
  `--max-latency-ms` (`TOKENDAMPER_MAX_LATENCY_MS`). They are now a hard `Unknown argument`
  error rather than being accepted and ignored.

  **Nothing functional was lost.** No stage, validator or planner ever read them — risk tolerance
  reached one benchmark display column and stopped. A script passing them will now fail instead
  of silently doing nothing, which is the point: the previous behaviour reported success for a
  setting that had no effect (audit H4, DECISIONS §44).

- **MCP `optimize_context` no longer accepts `riskTolerance`.** Same reason. It gained
  `targetReductionRatio`, which is the parameter that actually does something.

- **`GatewaySessionStoreInterface` requires `getSession`.** Any third-party implementation must
  add it. Reading a session must not create one (audit M5).

- **The Gateway no longer reads `TOKENDAMPER_MOCK_UPSTREAM` or `NODE_ENV`.** Both are now
  explicit options (`mockUpstream`, `allowMissingUpstreamCredentials`). A proxy in an environment
  that happened to set either no longer changes behaviour (audit M8, DECISIONS §44).

### Highlights

- **The MCP entry mode does something.** `optimize_context` had no budget parameter, so it was a
  guaranteed 0% no-op that reported success. Measured through the stdio server: 0 stages / 0.0%
  without a budget, 4 stages / **69.1%** at `targetReductionRatio: 0.3`.
- **`optimize` takes multiple files and directories**, which is what makes the 0/1 knapsack
  reachable at all. On this repo's `src/core` at `--max-input-tokens 4000`: 31 files in,
  **15 pruned, 20,540 tokens saved** by the planner.
- **One bad item no longer reverts the good ones** (Phase 1c). On the 45-file Python corpus the
  stages were already achieving 42.52% while the product emitted **0.00%**, because 26 constraint
  failures across 14 items reverted all 45. It now emits **22.73%**.
- **Structured provider content survives the Gateway.** A `tool_result` block could ship as a
  bare string — a `400` from Anthropic — and the audit's "masked by the drift gate" assessment
  was wrong for the one case the Gateway actually saves on.
- **A 0% result now says why.** Whether a budget was in effect (`budgetApplied`), whether any
  transform could reduce the language at all (`trace.languageSupport`), and whether items were
  reverted (`trace.itemsReverted`).
- **`tokendamper bench` runs when installed.** It threw for every user outside a checkout.
- **The docs say what the validators actually check** — bracket/quote integrity, not syntax
  validity — with a per-language table pinned by tests.

### Known limitations, stated deliberately

- Elision reduces **TypeScript/JavaScript and Python only**. Twelve of nineteen recognised
  extensions cannot produce a non-zero reduction under any flag; runs on them now say so rather
  than returning a silent 0%.
- **Gateway mode is experimental** and saves nothing across turns by design.
- `--target-reduction-ratio` engages the planner but is **not** a proportional target; the planner
  reads it only as `> 0`.
- Drift remains bundle-scoped: a run failing on drift alone still falls back whole.

### Documentation
- **`docs/audit-remediation-status.md` is the entry point for audit work**, and `CLAUDE.md` points
  at it. It carries what is merged, the measured corpus baseline, exactly what Wave 2 requires,
  and the traps this codebase has for anyone changing it — replacing status prose scattered across
  several documents rather than adding to it (audit M11).

  `CLAUDE.md` corrections, all of which other notes reasoned from: *"`createContextBundle` makes a
  single-item bundle for CLI/bench, so `R_AST` is a boolean"* is false on both halves since §43;
  *"for code, `R_struct` is pinned at 1.0"* is fixed by §40 (and the audit's proposed fix for it
  was measured **inert**); invariant 9's rationale restated, since `emittedOutput` is no longer a
  newline-joined blob; the 19.27% figure marked as belonging to a smaller corpus.

- **Corpus harness recipe: `typescript` 57 → 59**, the two files H5 added. `collect.js` would
  otherwise refuse on the next run — which is it working as designed. A clean post-wave baseline
  is recorded in the status doc: Python **23.14%** (file) / **22.66%** (stdin), TypeScript
  **25.35%** (file) over 59 files. That last figure is *not* comparable to §43's 29.55%: same
  engine, larger denominator.

- **Corpus harness recipe, again after Wave 2: `typescript` 59 → 60, `prose` 28 → 29.** The
  TypeScript file is `src/bench/fixtures/bundled-path.ts` (M10); the prose file is
  `docs/audit-remediation-status.md`, which landed in `7a1b5a7` **after** the `dd540fe` baseline
  was recorded and was therefore already outstanding. `collect.js` refused on both before
  measuring anything.

  TypeScript file reads **23.26%** over 60 files, down from 25.35% over 59 — and that movement is
  entirely the denominator: `reduced` is unchanged at 33, and a per-row A/B against the
  pre-Wave-2 engine over the *same frozen corpus* found **594 of 594 rows identical** across 15
  fields. Wave 2 changes no stage output. See DECISIONS §44.

### Added
- **A file that fails a check no longer reverts the rest — Phase 1c, audit §3.1.** Validation is
  bundle-scoped and fallback was all-or-nothing, so on the frozen 45-file Python corpus the
  stages achieved **42.52%** and the run emitted **0.00%**: 26 `CONSTRAINT_DIRECTIVE_LOST` errors
  across 14 items reverted all 45, with drift at 0.0359 against a 0.40 gate and AST clean.

  Failures that name an item now revert only that item; the repaired bundle goes back through the
  **same** `validate` and is emitted only if it passes. Repair changes which bundle is offered,
  never what counts as valid.

  | bundle | before | after | reverted |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 45 Python files | 0.00% | **22.73%** | 14 |
  | 61 TypeScript files | 0.00% | **19.47%** | 21 |

  Three supporting changes: `ValidationIssue.itemId` is a field rather than text interpolated
  into `message` (recovering it by regex would have been audit M5b exactly); `validate()` returns
  `attribution` with `repairableItemIds` and `hasUnattributableError`; and `trace.itemsReverted`
  names what was put back, so a partial success cannot be mistaken for a clean run.

  **The refusal rule was tried too strict and corrected by measurement.** "Refuse if any error is
  unattributable" reads as the conservative choice, but the TypeScript bundle fails on both
  attributable constraint losses *and* `SEMANTIC_DRIFT_EXCEEDED` at 0.4122 — so the failure that
  named nothing discarded the attribution that named 21 items, and the run stayed at 0.00%. The
  gate is now "is there a principled subset to revert?", which is safe because the candidate is
  re-validated regardless: reverting items lowers semantic loss, and drift fell 0.4122 → 0.0056
  (TypeScript) and 0.0359 → 0.0141 (Python).

  Repair declines, and routes to the real fallback, when *every* changed item would be reverted —
  that is a fallback wearing a different name, and the distinction is load-bearing because
  fallback echoes `request.rawInput` (the CLI writes the original `Buffer`) while repair renders
  from items. DECISIONS §35 exists because those are not the same bytes for non-UTF-8 input.
  Measured: 14 of 14 single-file fallbacks remain byte-identical, and **574 of 574 corpus rows
  are unchanged** — the harness measures single-file runs, where repair cannot fire.

- **A 0% run now says whether the language could ever have been reduced — audit H2.** Twelve of
  nineteen recognised extensions cannot produce a non-zero reduction under any flag combination,
  and that was indistinguishable from a file with nothing worth compressing. `trace.languageSupport`
  now carries `supported`, `unsupported`, `unsupportedLanguages`, `noneSupported` and a `reason`,
  and `validate()` raises an **info** issue (`LANGUAGE_NOT_ELIDIBLE`) that does not vote on the
  verdict. Every language is still accepted — pass-through is byte-identical, and refusing it
  would remove a working behaviour to make a point.

  Measured, elision reduces **3 of 17** probed languages (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python), which
  is the audit's headline and the corpus agreeing independently. The predicate is
  `supportsRegionElision` and nothing looser: a first attempt asked "does the item yield symbols?"
  and called Go supported, because a trivial Go file yields exactly one — `import:fmt`, an
  incidental match by the TypeScript import regex.

- **`optimize` accepts multiple paths and directories — audit H5**: `tokendamper optimize a.ts
  b.ts` and `tokendamper optimize ./src`. This is what makes the 0/1 knapsack reachable:
  `createContextBundle` produced exactly one item for every shipping entry point, prefix locking
  pinned item 0, the solver always selected it, and `itemsPruned` was always 0 — so the knapsack,
  cache-aware prefix locking, topology scoring, the dependency graph and the git inspector could
  not affect any output the product could produce. Measured on `src/core` at
  `maxInputTokens: 4000`: **31 items, 15 pruned, 20,540 tokens saved by the planner.**

  One item renders as its content and nothing else, so CLI, MCP and bench stay byte-identical.
  More than one renders with a `==> path <==` header per item. Fail-open is **per file** — each
  file's original bytes, never a re-encoding — so DECISIONS §35 holds per item; the stream as a
  whole is not byte-identical because the headers are TokenDamper's. Directory walks are sorted
  (prefix locking pins the first ~1,024 tokens, so order decides what bypasses the knapsack) and
  skip `node_modules`, `dist`, `.git` and friends.

  **Multi-file runs still fall back on real corpora**, and not for any reason this change can fix:
  on the 45-file Python corpus, drift 0.0359 and AST clean, but 26 constraint failures across 14
  items revert all 45. Validation is bundle-scoped and fallback is all-or-nothing (audit §3.1,
  Phase 1c). This delivers the mechanism; §3.1 stands between it and the outcome. See DECISIONS §43.

### Removed
- **Twelve narrative documents, 226 KB — audit M11.** `NOTES-FOR-DOCS.md`, `study.md`,
  `purposed architecture changes.md`, `tokendamper-headroom-known-issues.md`, and the eight
  `docs/phase-*` / `docs/issue-2-*` files. Markdown drops from 31 files to 19, and markdown:src
  from 1.40:1 to **0.95:1**. `docs/retired-documents.md` maps each file to where its conclusion
  now lives and gives the `git show` command to read the original.

  **The 4.1:1 premise was stale**: measured before acting it was already 1.40:1, and not because
  the docs had shrunk — they had grown to 726 KB — but because `src/` grew faster. Since **32.8%
  of `src/` is comment prose**, prose:code actually ran ~2.6:1. The in-source commentary is
  deliberately kept: the failure mode M11 names is two copies of an argument kept in sync by hand,
  and a comment next to its code is not that.

  Twenty-five source and test citations to retired documents are marked `[retired]` rather than
  re-pointed — the citation names something git still holds, and re-pointing 25 of them by hand
  would risk mapping some to the wrong place. `CHANGELOG.md` and `DECISIONS.md` keep their older
  citations untouched, each with a note saying why: they record what was true when written.

- **Three knobs that were parsed, validated and then read by nothing — audit H4.**
  `--max-output-tokens` and `--max-latency-ms` (with `TOKENDAMPER_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` and
  `TOKENDAMPER_MAX_LATENCY_MS`) reached no consumer anywhere in the pipeline;
  `--risk-tolerance` / `TOKENDAMPER_RISK_TOLERANCE` / the MCP `riskTolerance` property reached
  exactly one, `cli/bench-table-renderer.ts:97`, which prints it in a column. Setting any of them
  exited 0 and changed nothing.

  Removed from the **surface only** — the `OptimizationBudget` fields stay, because
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` pins that model as frozen; each now carries a doc comment naming its consumer
  or stating it has none. A removed flag is a hard `Unknown argument` error, not a silent no-op.

  `--target-reduction-ratio` deliberately stays despite the planner reading it only as `> 0`:
  it is the only budget flag every doc and example uses, and making it a real proportional target
  is a planner change. See `docs/audit-remediation-status.md`.

### Fixed
- **Structured message content was flattened to a string and shipped as one — audit C4, and it
  was *live*, not latent.** The Gateway ingests a provider message as
  `JSON.stringify(msg.content)` and used to write the optimized item back as a plain string, so a
  message whose content was `[{"type":"tool_result","tool_use_id":"toolu_01ABC",…}]` could reach
  the provider as a bare string — a `400 invalid_request_error` on Anthropic, and broken
  multimodal parts on OpenAI.

  The audit records this as "masked by H1 — that is luck". **Measured, the mask covers only half
  the cases.** A cross-turn *sole* copy is scored in full by drift and does fall back. Content
  duplicated **within one payload** is elided `recoverable: true`, which drift exempts by
  substitution — no fallback, and it ships. On the pre-fix engine that payload returned
  `messages[2].content` as the string `"{\"__td_block__\":\"[TokenDamper Elided: …]\"}"` with
  `fallbackUsed: false` and `tokensSaved: 42`. Within-payload duplication is also the only case
  the Gateway saves anything on at all (DECISIONS §41), so C4 was live on exactly the path the
  mode exists for.

  Items now carry `contentShape`, and `core/elision` refuses to elide anything structured —
  at the shared chokepoint rather than in the Gateway, so the guard survives any widening of the
  stage list. `ElisionSkipReason` gained `'structured_content'`, which failed to compile in all
  three eliding stages until each acknowledged it, and stages report
  `skippedStructuredContent`. Untagged items are treated as plain text, so CLI, MCP and bench are
  unaffected — confirmed by **594 of 594 corpus rows identical** to the pre-fix engine.

- **A hole in `messages` shifted every later item onto the wrong message — audit C4.** Ingestion
  skips falsy entries with `if (!msg) continue`, while egress indexed `finalBundle.items[idx]` by
  array position. Also **not** masked: the pinning test fails against the pre-fix engine with
  `expected 'ok' to be 'export function helper0…'` — the assistant's message had received the
  previous item's content. Items now carry `payloadSlot` and egress looks it up, which also
  survives a stage that reorders or drops items.

- **The Anthropic `system` prompt is mapped back — audit C4.** It was ingested as `items[0]`
  while the egress map started at `itemOffset`, so any change to it was dropped from `finalBody`
  while `optimizedTokens` — and therefore `tokensSaved` and `dedupRatio` — still counted it as
  saved. **This path is unreachable today** (`cleanup:session-dedup` refuses system items, and
  rehydration needs `rehydrateRefs`, which the Gateway does not set); the change makes the
  mapping correct for when it is not, and guards the `finalBody` rebuild against dropping or
  duplicating `system`.

- **The MCP entry mode did nothing — audit M5a.** `optimize_context` had no
  `targetReductionRatio` parameter, so a client calling the tool as documented got
  `pass_through`, zero stages, the input back unchanged and `reductionRatio: 0` with **no
  error**. The parameter is now in the schema (range-checked, and rejected rather than clamped),
  the description states that a budget is required, and the response carries `budgetApplied`,
  `planMode`, `stagesExecuted` and a `notice` when no budget was in effect — so a 0% result can
  no longer hide whether anything ran. Measured through the stdio server on
  `src/core/planner/index.ts`: **0.0% / 0 stages without a budget, 69.1% / 4 stages at
  `targetReductionRatio: 0.3`**, cross-checked against the CLI's `tokenEstimateSaved: 586` on the
  same file.

- **MCP session rehydration had never worked — audit M5b.** `rehydrate_context` looked for
  `<ELIDED: ref=… >`; `cleanup:session-dedup` emits `[TokenDamper Elided: ref=… bytes=… kind=…]`.
  The pattern could not match any marker the product produces, so the tool returned its input
  unchanged on every call. `renderSessionElisionMarker` and `SESSION_ELISION_MARKER_PATTERN` now
  live together in `core/elision/marker.ts` and are used by both sides; the new test builds its
  marker by **running the stage** rather than restating the format, which is how the two drifted
  apart in the first place.

- **Gateway response headers were the caller's request headers — audit M9.** Both optimize paths
  spread `cleanHeaders` into the response, and `cleanHeaders` strips only `host` and
  `content-length` — so `authorization`, `x-api-key` and cookies came back out on the way down.
  Response headers are now constructed explicitly.

- **`bench` threw for every installed user — audit M10.** The bundled datasets resolved against
  `process.cwd()` only, and `test/` was not in `package.json`'s `files`. Fixtures now ship, and
  resolve against the working directory first and the package root second — the root found by
  walking up to the nearest `package.json`, because this module runs at two different depths
  (`src/…` under vitest, `dist/src/…` compiled) and a fixed `..` offset is right for exactly one.
  Verified by running the built CLI from a directory with no `test/` tree. Also:
  `loadBenchmarkFixtures` no longer throws `EISDIR` when handed a directory.

- **MCP reads no longer create state, and traces no longer leak between servers — audit M5
  (minor).** `get_session_metrics` and `resources/read` called `getOrCreateSession`, so asking
  about an unknown session invented it — reporting a plausible all-zero record and, under
  `maxSessions`, potentially evicting a live one; both now use the new read-only
  `GatewaySessionStore.getSession` and report a miss. `traceStore` was a module-level `Map`
  shared by every server in the process and is now per-server. `initialize` now negotiates
  against the client's requested protocol version instead of asserting its own unconditionally.

- **Three defects H5 exposed, each fixed with it**: pruning was scored as semantic drift
  (`findUnwitnessedItems` exempted pruned items but the ratios compared whole bundles — now scored
  over retained items, guarded on ids corresponding so a caller that rebuilds its bundle gets more
  measurement rather than none); whole-item elision of a symbol-bearing item is no longer attempted
  (since §40 it scores `S_k = 1.0` and can never survive validation — two pure-`types.ts` files
  were taking a 16-file batch down); and `TD_PRESERVE:` no longer matches its own implementation
  (`drift-tracker.ts` and `cli/html-reporter.ts` each acquired a phantom content marker, and one
  such marker being elided drove `R_struct` to 0 and a 16-file batch to `S_k = 0.4053` on a run
  with **99.1%** real symbol retention — this also retires the `html-reporter.ts` regression §40
  recorded as deliberate). Also: envelope headers were counted on the output side only, so a
  multi-item fallback reported 72,973 → 73,667 tokens, the same shape as the phantom −1.39%
  (Issue 5). Corpus: **1 row changed, 0 regressions**, TypeScript 27.33% → **29.55%**.

- **Constraint directives are extracted from prose regions, and checked per item — audit H6**:
  the nine-keyword imperative scan (`must`, `never`, `required`, `critical`, …) is written for
  natural-language prompts and was applied to raw content of every kind. In source, `required`
  and `critical` are ordinary identifiers, and `CONSTRAINT_DIRECTIVE_LOST` was the single largest
  cause of code not being optimized — **24 of 40 fallbacks** on the audit's corpus.

  Measured over a frozen 293-file corpus, classifying every dropped directive by origin: Python
  **16 prose / 38 code** (nearly all `logger.critical(...)`), TypeScript **38 prose / 13 code**
  (`readonly required?`, error-message literals). So neither extreme works — trusting it
  everywhere keeps 51 false positives, and the audit's proposed "skip `code` entirely" discards
  54 genuine constraints including the Python docstring case that
  `docs/phase-1d-semantic-gate-disposition.md` measured this check to be the only thing catching.
  The separator is the **region**, not the content type.

  Extraction now covers line comments, block comments and Python docstrings within code, and
  whole content for prose types. Retention is checked **per item** rather than against a joined
  blob — previously a directive from item A was satisfied if the string appeared anywhere in item
  B, so the check could pass for content that was destroyed, and a loss anywhere failed the whole
  run with no attribution. Items absent from the after-bundle are skipped (selection is not
  elision, matching `findUnwitnessedItems`).

  | bucket / route | before | after |
  |---|---|---|
  | python (file) | 14.98% | **23.14%** |
  | python (stdin) | 14.88% | **22.66%** |
  | typescript (file) | 23.38% | **27.33%** |

  **20 of 586 rows changed, none regressed.** TypeScript now has zero code-sourced directives
  remaining; every surviving `CONSTRAINT_DIRECTIVE_LOST` is a genuine imperative in a comment or
  docstring, which is the check working rather than misfiring. Landed after §37 deliberately —
  this check was previously the only thing preventing markdown deletion. See DECISIONS §42.

- **`tokendamper exec` reaches its own gateway — audit C3, L2 (partial)**: `runExecCommand`
  injected a token as `TOKENDAMPER_GATEWAY_TOKEN`, a variable **nothing in `src/` read** and no
  third-party client has heard of, while the server required it on every request. Reproduced by
  spawning a real child: every request returned `401`, and `exec` exited **0**. The existing
  suite passed throughout because its gateway test presented the header no real client sends.

  Loopback peers are now trusted — the server binds to `127.0.0.1`, so a loopback peer was
  already the only peer able to connect, and the token was protecting one local process from
  another while costing the entire mode. Determined from `req.socket.remoteAddress` (never a
  header, since `X-Forwarded-For` is attacker-supplied), including `::1` and `::ffff:127.0.0.1`.
  The token is still enforced on any non-loopback bind.

  **`HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` are no longer set.** `GatewayServer` implements neither
  absolute-form request URIs nor `CONNECT`, so any child honouring them would have failed to
  reach the provider entirely — a second failure, independent of the 401 and masked by it.
  Base-URL interception is now the only supported mechanism. Also removes `?token=` query
  authentication (a credential in logs and shell history) and makes the header comparison
  constant-time.

### Changed
- **The documented guarantee is "bracket/quote integrity", not "syntax validity" — audit M1.**
  The TypeScript validator builds no AST; it is a lexer detecting unbalanced brackets and
  unterminated strings. Probed against the shipped code, it passes `const x = ;`,
  `import from "x";`, `let 123abc = 5;`, `const a = 1 +++++ 2;` and plain English prose, failing
  only on `super(; }`. `README.md` gains a per-language table of what each validator does and does
  not catch; `CLAUDE.md` says the same; `test/unit/validator-guarantee.test.ts` pins every row as
  a characterization test, so strengthening a validator fails the test on purpose and the table
  has to move with it.

  Wiring the real TypeScript compiler API was **refused on cost, not principle**: `typescript` is
  a development dependency today, and promoting it to runtime costs install size and parse latency
  against a lexer that runs in single-digit milliseconds.

- **Gateway test seams are parameters, not environment variables — audit M8.**
  `TOKENDAMPER_MOCK_UPSTREAM=true` made the proxy return the caller's own optimized prompt with a
  200 as though a model had written it, and `NODE_ENV === 'test'` waived the missing-credentials
  401 — a variable many CI systems set for unrelated reasons. Both env reads are **removed**, not
  demoted to fallbacks, and replaced by `mockUpstream` and `allowMissingUpstreamCredentials` on
  `ProxyHandlerOptions`, `GatewayConfig` and `ExecOptions`.

  Ten tests in `test/unit/gateway.test.ts` failed the moment the `NODE_ENV` branch went — they
  had been passing *because vitest sets that variable*, none of them mentioning it. That is the
  finding, demonstrated.

- **Gateway mode is documented as experimental, and the cross-turn saving claim is withdrawn —
  audit H1, M4**: measured over real sockets on two-turn conversations where a resent history
  contains each block once, the Gateway saves **0 bytes and falls back on every turn**, for code,
  prose and JSON tool results alike.

  This is a design conclusion, not a defect. `cleanup:session-dedup` marks an elision recoverable
  only when an intact copy survives in the same payload (§16); a sole copy seen only in a previous
  turn is refused because the consumer is a stateless provider API with no rehydration mechanism,
  so the marker would be deletion rather than reference. No cross-turn transform is available
  without provider-side resolvability, which does not exist.

  README, ARCHITECTURE.md and CLAUDE.md invariant 8 now say so. The measurement is pinned by
  `test/integration/gateway-dedup-reality.test.ts` rather than left as prose — if a cross-turn
  saving ever appears, either resolvability was implemented or the drift gate was relaxed.

  The remaining M4 claims are resolved rather than deferred: knapsack planning marked
  implemented-but-unreachable (H5), token hashing qualified as irreversible on the CLI by design,
  and `TOKENDAMPER_RISK_TOLERANCE` marked as having no effect on optimization (H4, still open).
  See DECISIONS §41.

- **`R_struct` no longer votes on evidence it never gathered, and a local variable is no longer
  a symbol — audit C1b, §3.2**: two changes that only work together.

  **The audit's proposed fix is inert on its own.** §3.2 proposed computing `R_struct` over
  `extractContentMarkers` to exclude the indestructible `filepath:` marker, and said this "would
  fix both cases at once". Measured, it fixes neither: removing the only marker an item had
  leaves the before-set empty, and an empty set defaults `R_struct` back to **1.0** — the
  identical free 0.40 by another route. That change alone was byte-identical across all 586 rows
  of a frozen 293-file corpus. The free 0.40 comes from the **empty-set default**.

  So an unmeasured ratio is now *excluded* from the score rather than defaulted, with its weight
  redistributed. For code `S_k = 1 - R_AST`, and the maximum symbol loss that can pass falls from
  **66.7% to 40%**. When neither ratio measured, retention stays silent — that case belongs to
  the measurement gate (§37).

  **Applied alone, that cost 14 TypeScript files and 11.75pp — guarding against loss that was
  almost entirely fictitious.** `extractSymbols` matched `const|let|var` anywhere, so function
  locals counted as semantic symbols on par with exports, and body elision is exactly what
  removes them. On `src/core/engine/index.ts`, 42 of 63 symbols "lost" — **41 function-local**;
  on `tokenizer.ts`, 9 of 17 — **all 9**. No exported function, type or interface was lost in
  either case, because `selectElisionRegions` retains signatures by construction. Python is the
  control: no locals rule, 0.0% measured symbol loss, unaffected by either half.

  | arm | TS files reducing | TS saved | Python |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | before | 22 | 14.00% | 14.98% |
  | C1b alone | 8 | 2.25% | 14.98% |
  | symbol fix alone | 30 | 25.59% | 14.98% |
  | **both (shipped)** | **29** | **23.38%** | 14.98% |

  The gate is stricter *and* reduction is higher, because it now measures semantic loss instead
  of noise. One file regresses — `src/cli/html-reporter.ts`, whose sole content marker is
  `TD_PRESERVE:` harvested from a **regex literal** in the file implementing that directive's
  highlighting. Left in deliberately: it fails conservatively (byte-identical fallback, no data
  loss) and special-casing it would over-fit the metric to one file.

  Two hazard-pinning tests asserted properties this abolishes and were updated with their
  findings preserved: the 0.60 "ceiling for code" (which was the symptom, not a safety property)
  and C1a's note that the retention gate could never fire for markdown (it now does). See
  DECISIONS §40.

- **The explainability trace now explains — audit M6**: `buildTrace` projected every
  `StageResult` down to `{ stageId, status, durationMs: 0, changed }`, discarding each stage's
  `metrics` and `notes` and hardcoding the duration. `StageTrace` now carries `metrics` and
  `notes` verbatim, and `durationMs` is measured by the engine with `performance.now()` — by
  the engine because a stage that read a clock would stop being a pure function of its input
  (invariant 1), and `performance.now()` because most stages finish inside a millisecond and
  integer resolution would report the same uninformative `0` the constant already did.

  A CLI trace now shows, for example, `regionsHashed: 4`, `bytesSaved: 14509` and
  `irreversibleElisions: 1` with the note explaining that no token hasher was supplied so the
  removed content is retained nowhere — none of which was previously knowable from the trace.

  **`pruning:topology-pruner`'s note was not vague, it was false.** It returned "All items fit
  within token budget; no pruning required." unconditionally whenever `itemsPruned === 0`;
  measured, a 5,405-token file at `maxInputTokens: 10` reported that all items fit. The note now
  distinguishes the three cases and names the mechanism (everything pinned by cache-prefix
  locking → pinned items bypass the knapsack → the budget could not be enforced), and the
  metrics carry `bundleTokens` and `maxTokens` so the claim is checkable. This does not fix H5,
  but it stops the trace concealing it. Guarded by `test/unit/trace-explains.test.ts`, verified
  to fail 4/4 against the unfixed trace. See DECISIONS §39.

- **The Gateway no longer corrupts non-ASCII request bodies — audit C2, L3**:
  `GatewayServer.onRequest` accumulated the body with `body += chunk`, decoding each chunk
  independently, so a multi-byte UTF-8 sequence straddling a chunk boundary became U+FFFD on
  both sides — at the socket, before the pipeline exists, on the bytes forwarded upstream.
  Measured with two-write splits on a continuation byte: `héllo — ünïcode ✓ 日本語 😀` went out
  94 B and forwarded as **98 B** (`h��llo …`); CJK 76 → **82 B**; box-drawing 89 → **95 B**. A
  corrupted body is always *longer*, because U+FFFD re-encodes to three bytes.

  Now collects `Buffer[]`, concatenates on `end`, and decodes once. Bodies that fail a UTF-8
  round trip — which correct concatenation does not fix, since the decode is still lossy — are
  forwarded verbatim rather than optimized or rejected: optimizing would have every stage
  reasoning about content the caller never sent, and rejecting is not a transparent proxy's
  call. `ProxyRequestResult` gains `bodyBytes` for this, preferred over `body` by both the
  upstream `fetch` and `writeProxyResult`.

  This is DECISIONS §35 at a different seam. Phase B applied that reasoning to the adapter that
  reads from disk and not to the one that reads from a socket, where it is worse — the bytes
  reach a provider, not a terminal. MCP was never affected: `setEncoding('utf8')` installs a
  `StringDecoder`, which holds partial sequences across chunks; manual concatenation is exactly
  what bypasses it.

  Also removes the O(n²) body-size check, which re-measured the whole accumulated string on
  every chunk (L3). Guarded by `test/integration/gateway-byte-fidelity.test.ts`, verified to
  fail 4/4 against the unfixed server. See DECISIONS §38.

- **A document whose witnesses were all destroyed is no longer certified — audit C1a**:
  `DriftTracker.findUnwitnessedItems` asked *did evidence exist before?* (it built its probe
  from the **before** item), so an item whose witnesses were entirely destroyed was exempt on
  the grounds that they had once been there. Measured on this repository's own files, on both
  routes: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` **3,542 → 72 bytes** and `SECURITY.md` **1,154 → 72 bytes**, at
  `fallbackUsed: false`, `validation.passed: true`, both gates reporting `pass` — and
  unrecoverable on the CLI, which supplies no `TokenHasher`.

  Neither gate could fire, and the arithmetic is closed-form: prose yields no symbols so
  `R_AST = 1.0` as an empty-set default (a free 0.60), and `filepath:` is derived from
  `item.path` and survives any content transform, so `R_struct = 1/(N+1)` for N headings. Hence
  `S_k = 0.4·N/(N+1)`, which approaches 0.40 from below and never reaches it, against a gate
  firing on `> 0.40`. The two stdin rows landed on **exactly 0.400** and were admitted by the
  strict comparison.

  An item that changed is now refused when it yields no symbols **and** no content-derived
  markers survive in the *after* item. Scoped to symbol-free items, so whole-item elision of
  code still refuses as `SEMANTIC_DRIFT_EXCEEDED` (the accurate reason) rather than being
  relabelled; and strictly additive, so every §33 refusal still refuses.

  Cost, over a frozen 293-file corpus (586 rows, both routes): **4 rows changed, all four this
  defect.** Everything else byte-identical — TypeScript 14.00%, Python 14.98%, uncovered
  buckets 0.00%, all unchanged. Prose goes 0.67% → 0.00%, which was the loss. Guarded by
  `test/unit/drift-unwitnessed-elision.test.ts`, verified to fail against the unfixed tracker.
  See DECISIONS §37.

  **Deferred:** `filepath:` is still counted in `R_struct` (audit C1b). That is why `R_struct`
  is pinned at 1.0 for code, and why a code file can lose 66.7% of its symbols and pass. It
  moves every published figure and wants its own measurement pass.

- **The regression baseline now measures the fixture set the product ships — audit H3**:
  `test/integration/bench.test.ts` Tests 1–5 loaded `loadBenchmarkFixtures('humaneval')`, and
  Test 2 did not use the shipped fixtures at all — it built a private two-fixture set inline
  under an artificial `maxInputTokens: 50` and asserted 40% reduction against that. The suite
  was green while `tokendamper bench` printed **0.0% reduction, 40% fallback**. The two facts
  never met because no test ran the combined set: humaneval is the half that cannot fall back
  (0.00), codexglue sits at **0.80**, and only humaneval was ever loaded.

  All five tests now load the shipped combined set, and `baseline.json` records **measured
  truth** rather than a target: `minTokenReductionRatio` 0.40 → **0.0**, `maxFallbackRate`
  0.0 → **0.40**. The old values are retained in an `aspirational` block so the gap stays
  visible instead of being deleted.

  The new assertions use **equality**, not `>=`. A `>=` check against a measured floor of 0.0
  is vacuously true and can never fail — the same defect one level up. Equality means an
  *improvement* breaks the suite too and has to be recorded deliberately, which is what makes
  it a ratchet. Verified able to fail: mutating the recorded numbers turns 3 of 6 tests red.

  Two things the measurement surfaced that were not previously written down: every non-fallback
  fixture also reduces **exactly 0%**, because `BenchmarkRunner` supplies a `TokenHasher` and
  the engine rehydrates what it elided — so the shipped set produces no reduction by two
  independent mechanisms, not one; and `syntaxPassRate: 1.0` is now asserted *alongside* the
  40% fallback rate, since syntax is evaluated on emitted output and emitted output on fallback
  is the input. Test 3 keeps the historical `aba84df` finding intact, rescoped to humaneval,
  which is the only population it was ever true of.

- **The stale Gateway warning in `README.md` is removed — audit M4a**: it claimed the Gateway
  "bypasses TokenDamper's validation pipeline" and that `fallbackUsed` is "hardcoded `false`".
  Both have been untrue since Phase 1.0b (`proxy.ts` imports and calls `core/engine.optimize`;
  `fallbackUsed` is `result.fallbackUsed`). Replaced with the measured status rather than
  deleted, because removing a false warning while leaving the feature claims uncaveated would
  have made the page less accurate, not more: the notice now records that cross-turn dedup
  saves 0 bytes on ordinary traffic (H1), that `tokendamper exec` returns 401 to its own child
  (C3), and that non-ASCII bodies can be corrupted at the socket (C2). The contradicting note
  under the architecture diagram is corrected the same way.

### Changed
- **License metadata corrected to MPL-2.0 — audit M3**: `package.json` declared `"license":
  "MIT"` while `LICENSE` is a full Mozilla Public License 2.0 and `README.md` stated the project
  is licensed under it. `package.json` is publishable (`"private": false`, `files`,
  `prepublishOnly`) and npm treats its `license` field as authoritative, so scanners read MIT —
  permissive — and receive MPL-2.0 copyleft. `package.json` and `CLAUDE.md` now match `LICENSE`.
  "All rights reserved" is dropped from the README copyright notice, where it sat directly above
  an open-source grant and asserted its opposite. See DECISIONS §36.

- **`contentType: 'code'` no longer selects the TypeScript validator — Phase C**:
  `CONTENT_TYPE_VALIDATORS.code` is now `null`. `code` is a *family* tag set from a file
  extension covering ~19 languages, of which the AST-lite suite implements three; mapping the
  whole family to TypeScript meant every non-TS member was lexed by a scanner written for a
  different grammar. That is not a weaker check, it is a check that **invents** findings —
  measured false `AST_UNTERMINATED_STRING` / `AST_UNBALANCED_BRACKET` verdicts at perl 39/40,
  tcl 30/40, shell 22/40, powershell 7/40 (c and css 0/50, because the C-family scanner happens
  to fit). Shell and PowerShell are in `isCodeExtension` today, so those were live false
  verdicts on the file route: `$'…'` quoting, `'` inside comments, `${…}` expansion and
  `[[ … ]]` tests are ordinary syntax a TS lexer misreads. This is DECISIONS §17's finding —
  a verdict decided by apostrophe parity is not validating anything — reached from the
  extension side instead of the fence side, and removed for the same reason rather than tuned.

  **Nothing that was genuinely covered loses coverage.** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python and
  JSON all reach their validator through the `language` and `path` branches of
  `selectValidator`, which run *first* and are unchanged. What changes is that the remainder
  now report `validated: false` and appear on `trace.astCoverage` — DECISIONS §23's
  distinction, that an unexamined item is not a passing one.

  Two hazard-pinning tests asserted the old mapping deliberately and were updated to pin the
  new one (`test/unit/declared-language.test.ts`, `test/unit/bench/evaluator.test.ts`): the
  trap they record changed shape from *wrong* validation to *absent* validation, so the pins
  were kept and re-aimed rather than deleted. Three stale doc comments were corrected with
  them (`src/core/model/constructors.ts` ×2, `docs/phase-4b-pathless-code-scope.md` §6.3).
- **Fail-open now returns the caller's bytes — Phase B (DECISIONS §35)**: `resolveFallback`
  returns `request.rawInput`, which reads like a byte-identical echo and is not one —
  `rawInput` is a string the CLI decoded with `readFileSync(path, 'utf8')`, and that call turns
  every invalid byte into U+FFFD, which re-encodes to three bytes. Found by the Phase 0 harness:
  of 504 fallback runs, 502 were byte-identical and two were not. `vimspell.sh`, a Latin-1 file
  containing "Fernández-Sanguino_Peña", came back **1,462 → 1,466 bytes with
  `fallbackUsed: true`** — invariant 3 failing silently on the path whose purpose is safety.

  The CLI now reads bytes and decodes second, writing the `Buffer` on fallback. Input that does
  not survive a UTF-8 round-trip forces a fallback via a new
  `EngineOptimizationOptions.inputNotRepresentable`, because every stage and estimator
  downstream reasons about the decoded string — a reduction measured against corrupted input is
  worse than none. The check is a round-trip, not a BOM or charset sniff; valid UTF-8 with
  multi-byte characters is unaffected and pinned by test.

  **The refusal goes through the engine, not the adapter.** The first implementation returned
  early with the right bytes and *no trace at all*, and the harness immediately recorded two
  rows it could not parse — from outside, indistinguishable from a crash.

  Measured: fallback byte-identity **502/504 → 504/504**, 2 corpus rows changed, 0 unparsable
  traces.

- **The multi-item render is latent, and now checked rather than assumed (DECISIONS §35)**: the
  success branch joins item contents with `\n`, which CLAUDE.md described as the live half of
  1b. It has **no live consumer** — CLI, MCP and bench all build single-item bundles through
  `createContextBundle`, and the only multi-item producer (the Gateway) bypasses
  `emittedOutput` per invariant 9. Pinned by `test/unit/fallback-render.test.ts`, which asserts
  the flattening and that the render is not injective (two different bundles produce identical
  output), so making any consumer multi-item changes a test rather than a payload.

- **Markdown needs a marker that is not a `#` line — Phase A part 2 (DECISIONS §34, closes
  §32)**: `looksLikeMarkdown` accepted a single `#` heading, and `#` is the comment leader in
  shell, Perl, Tcl, Ruby, R, YAML and Python — so one `# Copyright …` line made a whole shell
  script a document, its comments were harvested as structural markers, and drift reported
  `structMeasured: true` on content nothing had examined.

  §32 deferred this seam as "requiring more than one `#` line… a classifier change with blast
  radius over every prose item". That is a **count** threshold, and counts point the wrong way —
  `tclConfig.sh` carries 79 markers to `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`'s 12. The discriminator that works
  is **shape**: code misclassified as markdown falls from **114 of 264 files to 12**, and **all
  25** real documents are retained. Blast radius over prose: zero files.

  The markdown list regex is repaired in the same change, and that is what makes the first half
  safe: `/(^|\n)(- |\* |\d+\.)\s+\S/` consumed the space after the bullet and then demanded
  another, so `- item` and `* item` never matched. 21 of 25 corpus documents tripped the old
  rule against 25 of 25 repaired — the difference between losing `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and not.

  **Neither half of Phase A closes the defect alone.** The measurement gate left shell over
  stdin untouched at 17.28%, because the fabricated headings *were* the witness it checks;
  seam 2 alone would have moved those files from the forged failure to the honest one. Together:
  every uncovered-language bucket goes to **0.00%**, while **258 of 258** rows in the AST-covered
  buckets and the prose bucket stay **byte-identical**. The combined result was predicted by an
  A/B patch before implementation and matched on all 578 rows.

  `test/unit/markdown-marker-allowlist.test.ts` is no longer a defect pinned by inversion. The
  `it.fails` contract went red with "Expected test to fail" the moment the remedy landed —
  exactly as §32 designed it — and now states the closure positively.

- **The measurement gate is no longer scoped to validator-covered items — Phase A part 1
  (DECISIONS §33)**: an item that changed, was not pruned away, and yields neither symbols nor
  content-derived markers is now refused whatever language it is in. §28 scoped this rule to
  covered items to protect prose; measured over the Phase 0 corpus, the scope protected the
  wrong population. All 25 real markdown files carry content markers and were never in reach
  of the rule, while what the scope excluded was uncovered **code** —
  `Unicode_Collate_Locale_ja.pl` at **57,037 → 19 tokens (100%)** on the *file-argument* route,
  `S_k = 0`, `measured: false`, `fallbackUsed: false`, because nothing covers `.pl`.

  **The Gateway keeps within-payload deduplication.** `resolveRecoverableElisions` substitutes
  original content for `recoverable` elisions before the gate runs, so they are structurally
  invisible to it — measured, within-payload dedup saves 44 of 129 tokens with and without the
  change. This is what separates it from lever 1, which keyed on `astCoverage.checked == 0`, a
  condition every dedup elision meets, and would have made the proxy a pass-through. What the
  Gateway does lose is cross-turn dedup of a **sole copy** — the population
  `docs/phase-1-stabilization-summary.md` §9 already described as sending the model a marker it
  cannot resolve.

  Measured cost: **62 of 578 corpus runs change** (perl 81.91% → 5.61% on both routes, css and
  c over stdin to 0.00%). Every AST-covered bucket, all 25 prose files, shell and tcl are
  **byte-identical**.

- **`DriftReport` carries `measurementGate` and `retentionGate` as separate verdicts
  (DECISIONS §33)**: `S_k` answered two questions with one scalar — *did anything witness this?*
  and *did enough survive?* — and `0.400` is reachable from two opposite configurations
  (`R_AST = 1` empty-set default with `R_struct = 0`, and `R_AST = 1/3` with `R_struct = 1`), so
  `>` versus `>=` arbitrated both together. `validate()` now reads `measurementGate` rather than
  re-deriving the distinction, so `SEMANTIC_DRIFT_UNMEASURABLE` and `SEMANTIC_DRIFT_EXCEEDED`
  are driven by the gate that fired. `calculateDrift`'s `symbolBearingItemIds` option is
  **removed** rather than left inert (§30).

  **This does not close the forged half.** Shell and Tcl are untouched: they classify `markdown`
  on one `#` comment, so their comment leaders are harvested as headings and they report
  `structMeasured: true` — fabricating exactly the evidence this gate checks. That is the
  classifier seam, and it is why Phase A is two changes.

- **Three tests were passing on the empty-set default and are corrected**: `engine.test.ts`'s
  emit-path fixture elided a witness-free `text` item and asserted `fallbackUsed: false`, which
  held only because drift measured nothing; two Gateway tests deduplicated a sole cross-turn
  copy. `declared-language.test.ts` asserted the pathless hole was still open on the undeclared
  route — it is now closed, and the test asserts that instead.

### Added
- **A frozen-corpus measurement harness — Phase 0 (`tools/corpus-harness/`)**: `collect.js`
  freezes a corpus by `sha256` manifest and pins the engine (commit, a hash over all
  `dist/**/*.js`, and a `dirty` flag); `measure.js` re-verifies every hash, spawns the shipped
  CLI on both routes, and dumps per-item traces to JSONL; `seam2.js` scores candidate
  classifier rules against the frozen set. Bucket counts and row counts are **asserted** — the
  4b.3 A/B loop measured 132 of 144 files because a glob covered one directory level, and the
  first run of this harness caught three count mismatches immediately.

  No engine change. Findings in `docs/phase-0-measurement-baseline.md`; 289 files, 578 runs.

- **Seam 2 measured, and DECISIONS §32's deferral reasoning corrected**: §32 deferred the
  `looksLikeMarkdown` seam on the grounds that it "could require more than one `#` line, but
  that is a classifier change with blast radius over every prose item". That is a *count*
  threshold, which `docs/phase-4b-lever-disposition.md` had already shown points the wrong way.
  A **shape** discriminator — require a non-`#` markdown marker, or any two distinct signals —
  takes code misclassified as markdown from **114 of 264 files to 12 (or 7 for the stricter
  variant), retaining all 25 prose files**. Zero prose casualties.

  It is a mitigation, not the fix: it converts §32-shaped items (fabricated markers,
  `measured: true`) into §28-shaped ones (nothing measured, `measured: false`, still reduces).
  Seam 3 stays load-bearing.

- **§32 is not a pathless-route defect — it reaches the file argument**: `.pl` and `.tcl` are
  not in `isCodeExtension`'s 19-entry list, so Perl and Tcl classify `markdown` when passed
  **by name**. Measured worst case: `Unicode_Collate_Locale_ja.pl` at **57,037 → 19 tokens
  (100% deleted)**, file route, `fallbackUsed: false`, `astCoverage.checked: 0`,
  `driftCoverage.measured: false` — two orders of magnitude larger than §32's `tclConfig.sh`.
  Corrections applied to `CLAUDE.md`, `DECISIONS.md` §32 and
  `docs/phase-4b-pathless-code-scope.md` §1, all of which framed the file route as the safe one.

- **The shipped markdown list regex does not match markdown lists**: `RE_LIST` is
  `/(^|\n)(- |\* |\d+\.)\s+\S/` — the alternation consumes the space after `-`, and `\s+` then
  demands another, so `- item` and `* item` do not match while `-  item` and `1. item` do.
  21 of 25 prose files trip the shipped rule against 25 of 25 under the repair. Recorded, **not
  fixed** — it belongs to whoever implements the seam, measured under the harness.

- **The §32 defect is pinned by inversion, not by assertion (DECISIONS §32)**: the
  `KNOWN DEFECT` block in `test/unit/markdown-marker-allowlist.test.ts` asserted the wrong
  behaviour and **passed**, which made the defect the suite's de facto specification — the
  only thing marking it as wrong was a docblock, and a docblock enforces nothing. The suite
  was asserting `structMeasured: true` on a 99%-deleted shell script as correct.

  It now states the **contract** and carries `it.fails`: green while the contract is violated,
  red with `Expect test to fail` the moment any remedy makes it hold. Verified in both
  directions — green today, red under a temporarily simulated remedy, then reverted.

  Three guards keep the inversion from going vacuous, since `it.fails` is satisfied by *any*
  throw: the pipeline result is computed at describe scope so a crash is a collection error
  rather than a swallowed pass; the preconditions live in a separate ordinary passing test
  that goes red if the fixture drifts; and the `it.fails` body holds exactly one assertion.
  The contract is remedy-agnostic and stated over the input rather than over trace fields,
  because `tclConfig.sh` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` are identical on every field the trace
  carries (`docs/phase-4b-lever-disposition.md` §1).

- **`MARKDOWN_MARKER_TYPES` says what its docblock says — Phase 4b.3 (DECISIONS §32)**: the
  allowlist is now `markdown` alone. It held `text`, `html`, `logs` and `unknown` while its own
  docblock said a new `ContentType` "should default to *not* harvesting these". `text` and
  `unknown` are the two **we could not tell** buckets, and a bucket meaning *we do not know
  what this is* cannot also mean *its `#` lines are headings*.

  **Measured inert, and that is the honest headline.** The four removed members yielded **zero**
  gated markers across five frozen corpora, and 132 files over stdin, 40 over the file route
  and both Gateway turns are byte-identical before and after. Worth having because the trap is
  latent — anything that starts classifying code as `text` gets the fabrication back for free —
  not because it moves a number.

  **It uncovered a larger defect that is deliberately not fixed here.** The fabrication 4b.3
  was scoped to remove is not in those buckets at all: `looksLikeMarkdown` fires on a single
  `#` heading, so every hash-commented shell script is classified `markdown` — 591 fabricated
  headings across 9 frozen scripts, 45 more across the 4 `pip` files 4b.2's probe declines,
  against 0 from the 62 `text`-classified files. Measured end to end on `tclConfig.sh`:

  ```
  1,877 -> 19 tokens (99.0% deleted)   fallbackUsed false   driftScore 0.4
  astCoverage    {checked: 0, unchecked: 1, uncheckedContentTypes: ["markdown"]}
  driftCoverage  {structMeasured: true, measured: true, contentMarkersBefore: 79, …}
  ```

  Deleted whole, nothing validated it, and drift reports `measured: true` on 79 markers that
  are every one of them a comment line. The fabricated markers do not merely inflate a score —
  **they forge the evidence that the score measured anything**, defeating the `DriftCoverage`
  reporting §28 added so this class would be visible. Pinned as a `KNOWN DEFECT`
  characterization test. §32 explains why none of the three available seams belongs to 4b.3,
  and how the finding reframes §28's deferred question: the population is not prose, it is
  everything no validator covers — including real code in every language the AST-lite suite
  does not implement.

- **A Python content probe — Phase 4b.2 (DECISIONS §31)**: pathless content that is
  structurally Python is now classified `code` with `language: 'python'`, without a
  declaration. `classifyContent` wraps a new `classifyContentShape`, which answers with both
  fields; the Gateway builds its items from that shape.

  4b.1 let the caller say what pathless content is, and on the MCP path the caller always
  knows. The **Gateway** is the case that cannot be closed that way — a provider payload has no
  language field anywhere in its schema — which is why §29 declined a Gateway declaration. For
  the traffic the proxy carries, a probe is the only route there is.

  **The probe proposes; the parser confirms.** The structural half is the scope document's
  measured rule (`strong >= 2`, density `>= 0.15`, disqualifiers `< 0.10`, comment lines
  neutral). The half that is not in that document is the answer to its own §6 risk 2: a probe
  may only claim content the validator for that language **already accepts**. A declaration is
  the caller's assertion and failing on it is right; a detection is our guess, and content that
  does not parse means the guess was wrong. So detection can never make an item less valid than
  leaving it alone would — a bad indent level, an unterminated string and a call truncated
  mid-argument are each rejected and land exactly where they landed before.

  | | detected | false positives |
  |---|---|---|
  | 45 `pip` Python (positive) | **39 (86.7%)** | — |
  | 64 repo TypeScript / 25 markdown / YAML / logs | — | **0** |

  Over **stdin with no declaration**, the `pip` corpus goes **0.02% → 12.27%** (1 → 19 files
  reducing, 0/45 → 39/45 items AST-checked) against the file-argument route's 12.34% — **99.4%
  of the achievable yield**. Collateral on the file route: **zero**. TypeScript over stdin is
  **unchanged**, deliberately: §4 measured TS positives at 0.283–1.000 against prose negatives
  reaching 0.333, so no threshold orders them, and no TS probe is proposed now or later.
  `--language` remains the route for it.

  Gateway measured as §6 requires — turn 1, where `session-dedup` cannot elide and any fallback
  would be a false positive by construction: no fallback, output byte-identical. Turn 2
  byte-identical before and after. **Zero new fallbacks on live traffic.** Deterministic 6/6.

  **Still open, and the yield table hides it:** an *undetected* pathless Python file is not just
  unoptimized but unprotected. `pip`'s `status_codes.py` is symbol-free, the probe declines it,
  nothing covers it, §28's refusal cannot fire, and it is elided whole and unwitnessed over
  stdin (44 → 27 tokens) while the file route correctly refuses it.

- **The caller can declare what the content is — Phase 4b.1 (DECISIONS §29)**: new CLI
  `--language` and `--input-name` flags, and new `language` and `path` properties on the MCP
  `optimize_context` tool schema. `item.language` already existed, was already **first** in
  `selectValidator`'s precedence, and was populated by **no adapter at all**.

  Two of the three entry modes are pathless by construction — `optimize -` has no filename
  and an MCP call is a string in a JSON-RPC frame — so classification fell to the content
  probe, which §17 deliberately left unable to detect code. The consequence was not a
  degraded result but no result: no validator covered the item, `selectElisionRegions` found
  no language, whole-item hashing pinned `S_k` at the formula constant `0.60`, and the
  pipeline fell back. **The one route that works is the one a coding assistant does not
  use.**

  Measured over two corpora frozen in a scratch directory (`sha256` manifests; engine A/B'd
  as `dist-before` at `5b19394` vs `dist-after`), tokens counted with real `cl100k_base`, at
  `--target-reduction-ratio 0.3`:

  | corpus | bare stdin | `--language` | file argument |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 64 repo TypeScript sources | 0.07% (2 files reduce, 57 fallbacks) | **19.27%** (25 files) | 19.27% |
  | 45 `pip` Python sources | 0.02% (1 file) | **12.34%** (19 files) | 12.34% |

  The declared route's output is **byte-identical to the file-argument route on all 109
  files**, and AST coverage goes from 0/109 items checked to 109/109. `--input-name` matches
  byte-for-byte too. Determinism holds across 6 fresh processes on both languages.
  **Collateral: zero** — every undeclared run, file or stdin, is byte-identical before and
  after the change, which is the property the spread-guarded item hash is there to protect.

  Two design points that are load-bearing rather than incidental:
  - **A declaration sets `language` and `contentType` together, never one alone.** Language
    alone leaves the tag at whatever the probe guessed, and `text`/`markdown` are in
    `DriftTracker`'s `MARKDOWN_MARKER_TYPES` — so a declared Python file would still have its
    `#` comments harvested as markdown headings and then "destroyed" by the elision that
    follows. Two comment lines are enough for the probe to call a Python file a markdown
    document. Content type alone fails the other way: `CONTENT_TYPE_VALIDATORS.code` is `null`
    (Phase C, above), so declared Python would be checked by **nothing** and report
    `validated: false`. When this entry was written that mapping was the *TypeScript* validator,
    so the same mistake produced a wrong verdict rather than a missing one — the coupling
    argument this bullet makes is unchanged either way.
  - **An unrecognized language is rejected at the adapters, not dropped in the model.** A
    `--language pyton` that quietly does nothing produces a run that looks declared, validates
    nothing, and reports a clean trace — invariant 10's shape.

  The **benchmark loader** is the third `createOptimizationRequest` call site and was the last
  one guessing with the answer in hand: `BenchmarkFixture.language` is a *required* field that
  `fixtureToOptimizationRequest` dropped. Harmless where a fixture's path agrees with its
  language; for a CodeXGLUE item with **no** path — `codexglue.ts` synthesizes
  `src/item_<id>.txt`, which classifies `text` — it was 4b.1's defect inside the harness that
  publishes this project's numbers (`checked: 0`, fallback, 133 → 133 tokens; declared, 133 →
  59). All ten bundled fixtures are byte-identical before and after.

- **A false declaration fails closed.** Found by the loader change breaking a bench test whose
  fixtures were English prose carrying `language: 'python'` — it had passed only because the
  loader ignored the field. Prose is exempt from §28's refusal *because no validator covers
  it*; declaring a language drags it under one, no symbols are found in English, and drift
  refuses. **The cost of a wrong declaration is the optimization, never the content** — the
  input comes back verbatim. Pinned as a test, since someone will eventually run
  `--language python` over a README. The bench fixtures are now Python, which is what they
  always claimed to be, and still clear their 40% threshold at 58.8% with zero fallbacks.

- **The pathless route inherits §28's protection.** Unplanned, and the strongest single
  result of 4b.1: §28 refuses to certify an unwitnessed elision only for items an AST
  validator covers, and nothing covers a pathless item — so over stdin a symbol-free barrel
  file was **still** being elided whole at `S_k = 0.0000` with no fallback, the exact defect
  `5b19394` is recorded as closing. Declaring the language brings the item under a validator
  and the refusal fires. Six files across the two corpora reduce under bare stdin and fall
  back once declared (`index.ts` 135 → 18 tokens unwitnessed; five other barrels and
  `pip`'s `status_codes.py`); every one is that class, and losing those "savings" is the
  point of them.
- **Sub-item hashing granularity (DECISIONS §20)**: `compression:token-hashing` now elides
  **function bodies** within an item and keeps the declarations around them, falling back to
  whole-item hashing only where no region can be selected (prose, logs, JSON, truncated code).
  New: `core/elision.elideRegions` (chokepoint) and `core/elision/regions.selectElisionRegions`
  (selection + the docstring guard).

  Whole-item hashing could never succeed on a single-item code bundle — it replaces every
  byte, so `R_AST` was a boolean and `S_k` pinned at the formula constant `0.60`, over the
  `0.40` gate every time. For code the gate reduces exactly to **`R_AST ≥ 1/3`**.

  Measured over 52 real source files through the CLI: **22 reduce with no fallback, mean
  52.99%**, byte-identical output across fresh processes (6/6). `codebase.py`:
  16,937 → 11,360 bytes, 5,029 → 3,281 tokens, **34.76%**, no fallback.

  ~~every elision reversible through the existing recovery valve~~ — **withdrawn.** That
  sentence read as a property of the CLI run it was attached to, and it is not one. The
  reversibility measurement injected a `TokenHasher`; the CLI injects none, so the recovery
  valve returns at its first line (`if (!hasher && !ledger) return undefined`) and the
  emitted markers resolve to nothing. Measured on `codebase.py` through the real binary: 19
  placeholders emitted, **0** resolvable. See the `reversible` entry under Fixed.

  Remaining fallbacks are the safety net working, not failures: 17 on constraint-directive
  retention (an imperative comment inside an elided body), 11 on drift over `0.40`, 2 on the
  regex-literal validator defect noted below.

  **The bundled bench corpus stays at 0.00%, deliberately.** Five HumanEval fixtures are
  docstring-only prompts refused by the guard; four CodeXGLUE fixtures are truncated stubs
  with no complete body. It is a completion benchmark, not a compression corpus.

  The **docstring guard** is the Phase 1d precondition: `HumanEval/0` otherwise elides to
  55.66% at `S_k = 0.0000`, AST-valid and reversible, with the function's entire
  specification removed — drift cannot see it, because docstrings carry no symbols and
  `R_struct` is inert for code. The guard defends that case, **not the class**.

### Changed
- **Elision markers say what they replaced (DECISIONS §24)**: `compression:token-hashing`
  emitted `<BLOCK_HASH:` + a 64-character digest + `>`, which on the CLI resolved to nothing
  and therefore told its reader that *something* had been removed and nothing else. Both the
  sub-item and whole-item paths now emit
  `[TokenDamper: <N> <kind> lines elided, <B> bytes, sha256:<12 hex>]` through one shared
  renderer. In place of a function body a reader now gets:

  ```
      def __init__(self, failure_threshold: int = 5, recovery_timeout: float = 30.0):
          [TokenDamper: 5 function-body lines elided, 202 bytes, sha256:4af59ca48228]
  ```

  **It costs nothing in bytes** — `codebase.py` through the real CLI goes 16,937 → **11,328**
  where it went → 11,360 before, because a 12-character digest buys back more than the words
  cost. In tokens the two estimators disagree in *sign* on one real marker
  (`EnhancedHeuristicTokenizer` +1, `ceil(len / 4)` −1); a controlled A/B on a frozen 80-file
  corpus keeps the same 22 files with the same fallback causes and moves the mean over kept
  55.50% → 55.09%. That −0.41pp is the less accurate estimator's opinion (§19).

  `<BLOCK_HASH:…>` is still *read*, so text captured earlier still round-trips. `TokenHasher`
  resolves the truncated digest through a prefix index and refuses an ambiguous prefix rather
  than substituting the wrong content.

  Whole-item elision on prose and logs was proposed for removal as "compute that can only
  produce fallbacks". Measured, it is not: prose alone passes at `S_k = 0.00` saving 78.4%
  and a log tail 97.5%. The 16/16 prose failures in this repository are engineering documents
  dense with imperative directives, which is a property of the corpus. See §24.

### Fixed
- **A flag the command does not read is now an error (DECISIONS §30)**: `parseArguments` ran
  one flag loop for every subcommand and each subcommand's return object picked out the fields
  it cared about, dropping the rest **in silence**. `tokendamper bench --diff --language python`
  and `tokendamper optimize x --report-json r.json` both parsed, discarded and exited 0.

  Worst of the three: `tokendamper mcp --config custom.json` was never parsed at all. The MCP
  branch of `runCli` **reads** `parsed.configPath`, but the parser returned for `mcp` before the
  loop that sets it, so it was permanently `undefined` — and `loadConfig` ignores a config file
  that does not exist rather than failing, so the server started on defaults with no signal in
  the exit code, on stderr, or in the config it reported. `mcp` now takes `--config` and every
  config/budget override, as its own branch always assumed.

  One `SUPPORTED_FLAGS` table keyed by what `runCli` actually consumes. An unsupported flag is
  a parse error naming every offender **and where each one applies**
  (``Unsupported for `tokendamper bench`: --diff (applies to: optimize).``), checked after the
  loop because `--mode bench` can change the command from inside it. `exec` stays outside the
  table — its arguments belong to the child process.

  This generalizes §29, which made the same argument for `--language` and then left the shape
  in place for eight other flags. **Breaking:** invocations relying on a silently ignored flag
  now exit 1.

- **An empty before-set is "nothing to measure", not "perfectly retained" (DECISIONS §28)**:
  `R_AST` and `R_struct` each default to `1.0` when their pre-optimization set is empty, so an
  item the extractors found nothing in scored as perfectly retained. That is invariant 10's
  ninth instance, and it was an approval to delete content outright — `src/index.ts` is
  fourteen `export * from './x';` lines, yields no symbols, and went **420 bytes → a 67-byte
  marker (86.15% of its tokens)** at `S_k = 0.0000`, no fallback, no complaint.

  Drift now refuses to certify an item that **changed**, that an **AST validator covers** (so
  symbols were the expected witness), and that produced **neither symbols nor content-derived
  markers**. New `SEMANTIC_DRIFT_UNMEASURABLE` issue code, distinct from
  `SEMANTIC_DRIFT_EXCEEDED` — one means the metric ran and the answer was too high, the other
  means it never ran on anything, and collapsing them would report a threshold breach for a
  score of 0.00.

  **`filepath:` is excluded from the evidence.** It is derived from `item.path`, not content,
  so no elision can destroy it; counting it would make every pathed item look witnessed. It
  still counts in `R_struct` — that is §18's separate argument and is untouched here.

  The check is **per item**, not per bundle. A bundle holding one richly-symbolled file next
  to a symbol-free barrel measures `astMeasured: true` while the barrel is deleted unwitnessed;
  the transform is per item, so the evidence check has to be too.

  Reported as well as enforced: `DriftCoverage` on `ValidationReport` and on the trace
  (`astMeasured`, `structMeasured`, `measured`, `contentChanged`, `symbolsBefore`,
  `contentMarkersBefore`, `symbolBearingItems`, `unwitnessedItems`), the same shape §23 gave
  syntax. `driftScore: 0` alone cannot distinguish "retained everything" from "found nothing".

  **Measured over 68 frozen repo sources (64 TS + 4 py), engine A/B'd by patching only this
  clause in `dist/`: 5 files change outcome, 0 collateral.** All five are pure barrel files
  (`src/index.ts`, `src/bench/index.ts`, `src/bench/fixtures/index.ts`, `src/config/index.ts`,
  `src/core/ledger/index.ts`), each previously reducing 13.33%–84.05% at `S_k = 0`. The 28
  files reducing under both variants hold an **identical** 48.52% aggregate — the rule costs
  nothing where drift could already measure.

  **Three things it deliberately does not do.**
  - **Prose is untouched.** No validator covers it, so `R_AST = 1.0` there is an inapplicable
    measurement rather than a failed one. Enforcing on it would make every prose bundle
    incompressible and end `cleanup:session-dedup` on the conversational traffic the Gateway
    exists to carry. That gap is real and now *visible* on `DriftCoverage` — closing it is a
    product decision about whether TokenDamper may compress prose at all, not a bug fix.
  - **Pruned-away items are untouched.** Dropping an item is a selection decision the planner
    exists to make under a caller's budget, and `R_AST` already scores it wherever the item
    carried symbols. The symbol-free-file-pruned case stays open as the planner's half.
  - **`R_struct`'s constants are untouched.** §18 stands.

  Turn-1 Gateway measured as required (`docs/phase-1-stabilization-summary.md` §8 method):
  `fallbackUsed: false`, no false positives; turn 2 falls back identically with the rule on
  and off, so the existing cross-turn behaviour is unchanged. Output byte-identical across
  6/6 fresh processes; fail-open holds — a refusal still returns the caller's input.
- **The benchmark harness measured a route nobody uses (4b.0)**: `run_benchmark.py` piped its
  fixtures to `tokendamper optimize -`. With no path the engine resolves no language, selects
  no elision regions, falls to whole-item hashing, and `S_k` pins at the formula constant
  `0.60` — so it fell back on **all four** fixtures and reported 0%. It now passes a **file
  argument**, the route a developer actually uses.

  Harness only; no engine code changed. Engine frozen at `95056df` across both runs (all 64
  `dist/**/*.js` hashes identical), fixtures frozen by `sha256` manifest.

  | fixture | before (stdin) | after (path) |
  |---|---|---|
  | `codebase.py` | 0.00%, fallback `S_k 0.60` | **27.61%**, no fallback |
  | `sample_logs.txt` | 0.00%, fallback (constraint directive) | 0.00%, unchanged |
  | `tool_output.json` | 0.00%, fallback `S_k 0.60` | 0.00%, unchanged |
  | `session.json` | −1.39%, fallback `S_k 0.60` | −1.39%, unchanged |

  **One fixture of four moves**, and that is the honest headline — this corpus is one Python
  file, one log and two JSON payloads, and only the Python file is reachable by the path route.
  Output byte-identical across 6/6 fresh processes.

  Percentages are `cl100k_base` via the harness's own `tiktoken`. The engine's trace calls the
  same `codebase.py` output **34.18%**; that is `EnhancedHeuristicTokenizer` self-reporting at
  its documented 24% mean absolute error. **Publish the `cl100k` figure.**

  Two things this does **not** fix. The −1.39% on `session.json` is the harness's *other*
  defect — `orig_tokens` comes from `count_tokens(json.dumps(messages))`, which discards the
  file's pretty-printing while the engine is handed and echoes the raw file. Separate concern.
  And the pathless route remains broken **in the engine** for stdin, MCP and Gateway callers;
  4b.0 stops the harness from misreporting it, and closes nothing else
  (`docs/phase-4b-pathless-code-scope.md`).

  Corrected as a consequence: Issue 3 is **closed for `codebase.py`** in
  `tokendamper-headroom-known-issues.md` — the drift abort there was the harness, and the
  question of whether it was "correct conservative behavior" was moot because the engine had
  never looked at the file. Issue 3 stays open for the two JSON payloads.
- **`looksLikeYaml` asks whether the input is predominantly YAML (DECISIONS §27)**: the probe
  was `/^(---\s*$)?([\w.-]+:\s+.+)$/m`, whose optional leading group cannot span a line, so it
  actually tested "some line looks like `word: text`". Measured **pathless** — the Gateway and
  MCP shape — it claimed `yaml` for **12 of this repository's 22 markdown documents**, on
  lines like `Responsibilities:` and `Note: the AST validators run in CLI mode`.

  §22 judged that harmless because `yaml` selects no validator. It was not:
  `DriftTracker.extractMarkers` gates markdown structural markers on an allowlist that
  excludes `yaml`, so the same pathless prose item yields **0 markers as `yaml` and 19 as
  `markdown`**. The mistag silently zeroed `R_struct`'s input on the one content type where it
  does real work.

  Now a per-line predicate with a majority requirement, like `looksLikeLogs`. Lines that are
  legal YAML *and* ordinary markdown (`#`, bare `- `) count on neither side, and block-scalar
  bodies are skipped. Measured, the populations do not overlap: real YAML samples score
  **1.000**, the highest-scoring prose document **0.455**; the threshold is 0.75. Pathless
  prose: 12 `yaml` → **0**. No change on the CLI code corpus — a file argument carries a path,
  and the extension already outranked the probe.
- **`TypeScriptValidator` reads regex literals (DECISIONS §26)**: it had no regex mode, so it
  counted the brackets and quotes inside one. `const re = /([^)]+/;` was reported
  `AST_UNBALANCED_BRACKET`, and **7 of this repository's own 64 TypeScript sources were
  rejected by their own project's validator** — three of them the classifier's regexes from
  §22. A `/` now opens a literal where a value may begin (the punctuation set
  `scanBraceSpans` already uses, plus reserved words that cannot end an expression), and an
  unterminated literal is dropped at the newline rather than run to EOF.

  Now 0 of 64 `src/` and 0 of 46 `test/` sources are rejected, pinned by a corpus test.
  End-to-end on a frozen 68-file corpus with the input held constant: fallbacks **37 → 36**,
  files reducing **29 → 30**, total emitted tokens **102,800 → 100,715**;
  `src/core/elision/regions.ts` reduces 52.56% where it used to fall back on a syntax error it
  did not have. `elideRegions`'s relative post-condition is unchanged — its other reason
  (truncated completion prompts, invalid on input) still holds.
- **`compression:token-hashing` no longer fabricates the store that makes it "reversible" (DECISIONS §25)**:
  line 23 was `options?.tokenHasher ?? new TokenHasher()`. That default registered every
  elided block into a store that was garbage-collected when the stage returned, so on the
  CLI — which supplies no hasher — the emitted `<BLOCK_HASH:…>` markers referred to content
  held by nothing. Measured on `codebase.py` through the real binary: 19 placeholders, **0**
  resolvable by any store in the process or out of it. The engine's own
  `detectCorruptedPlaceholders` reported clean, because it reads
  `if (hash && hasher && !hasher.hasHash(hash))` and there is no hasher.

  The hasher is now used only if the caller supplies one. Reversibility is recorded on the
  item (`metadata.reversible`) and in the stage metrics (`irreversibleElisions`), and stated
  in the stage notes. Emitted bytes are unchanged and do not depend on whether a hasher was
  passed. Reversibility on the CLI is not unimplemented but unachievable — a one-shot pipe
  has nowhere for a store to live — so the marker itself has to carry the information.

- **An unvalidated item no longer reads as a passing item (DECISIONS §23)**: `valid: true`
  meant both "a validator examined this and found no syntax errors" and "no validator covers
  this content type, so nothing was examined". `AstValidatorResult.validated` now separates
  them, `BundleAstValidationResult.unvalidatedItemIds` lists the uncovered items, and
  `ValidationReport`/`OptimizationTrace` carry `astCoverage` — which is what makes this
  visible on the CLI, whose only validation output is the stderr trace.

  **This partially reopens Phase 1a.** Replacing the Gateway's hardcoded `contentType: 'text'`
  with `classifyContent` (`ac16cec`) closed the JSON half of "no validator runs at all on
  Gateway items" and is recorded as closing the whole thing. It did not: `classifyContent`
  answered `html` for TypeScript, `selectValidator` has no `html` branch, and a pathless item
  carrying a file with an unterminated string literal returned `valid: true, issues: 0`.
  `selectValidator`'s content-type dispatch is now a total `Record<ContentType, …>`, so a tag
  dispatch has never heard of is a compile error. Pathless code stays unchecked by design
  (§17) — it is now reported as unchecked. `passed` is scoped to `severity: 'error'` so a
  coverage report cannot force a fallback.

- **Content classification no longer answers `html` for TypeScript (DECISIONS §22)**:
  `classifyContent` ran its content probes *before* its extension checks, and two of those
  probes were wrong. Measured on this repository: **46 of 57 TypeScript sources classified as
  `html`**, every markdown document as `html` or `yaml`, and a 75-line file of pure log
  output as `text`.

  Three causes: `looksLikeHtml`'s `/<\/?[a-z][\s\S]*>/i` matched from the first `<letter` to
  the **last** `>` in the input, so any generic parameter sufficed; `isCodeExtension` was
  consulted fifth, after four probes that could pre-empt it; and `looksLikeLogs` missed
  ISO-8601 both ways — it required the level before the date, and `\b\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\b`
  cannot match `T19:00:01` because `T` and `1` are both word characters.

  Now: every recognized extension resolves first; `looksLikeHtml` requires a matched
  open/close tag pair; `looksLikeLogs` requires a majority of lines to carry a clock time
  plus either a severity token or a leading timestamp. Regression fixtures are the
  repository's own files (`test/unit/content-classification.test.ts`).

- **Latency budget no longer decides a syntax verdict (DECISIONS §21)**: `validateItemAst`
  returned `valid: false` with `AST_SLA_EXCEEDED` when validation exceeded 5ms. Identical
  bytes therefore produced different verdicts depending on machine load — measured on a 16 KB
  Python file across six fresh processes: `valid(4.06ms) INVALID(5.28ms) INVALID(6.86ms)
  INVALID(8.04ms) INVALID(14.70ms) INVALID(17.58ms)`. It also fell the engine back on large
  valid files, reporting a syntax error that did not exist. The breach is now reported on
  `AstValidatorResult.slaExceeded` and does not touch `valid` or `issues`.

- **One Token Estimator (DECISIONS §19)**: every reduction figure the CLI, MCP and bench
  paths report was computed across a seam between two independent token estimators —
  `EnhancedHeuristicTokenizer` on a bundle's input side, inline `Math.ceil(len / 4)` on
  every output side. The heuristic runs 11–22% above `len / 4` on this corpus, so
  **byte-identical output registered as an 11–22% saving**. All measurement now routes
  through `estimateTokens` / `estimateBundleTokens` in `src/core/hashing/tokenizer.ts`;
  `countTokens` is called from exactly one place.

  Eleven sites changed: `core/model/constructors.ts` (×2 bundle constructors),
  `core/trace/index.ts`, `core/engine/index.ts` (`attemptAutomatedRehydration`),
  `core/planner/cache-aware.ts`, `gateway/proxy.ts` (×2), and the four stages that build a
  bundle. `session-dedup` and `delta-compression` also reported `tokenEstimateSaved` as
  `ceil(bytesSaved / 4)` — a third unit — now derived from the two bundle estimates.

  **The bundled bench corpus reduces by 0.00%, not 7.82%.** All ten fixtures emit
  byte-identical output; the 7.82% was the estimator gap. Measured before → after, at
  `targetReductionRatio: 0.30`:

  | Fixture | In bytes | Out bytes | Identical | Reported before | Reported after |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | `HumanEval/0` | 348 | 348 | yes | 17.92% | **0.00%** |
  | `HumanEval/1` | 504 | 504 | yes | 13.70% | **0.00%** |
  | `HumanEval/2` | 328 | 328 | yes | 9.89% | **0.00%** |
  | `HumanEval/3` | 446 | 446 | yes | 11.11% | **0.00%** |
  | `HumanEval/4` | 386 | 386 | yes | 11.01% | **0.00%** |
  | `CodeXGLUE/py/101` | 192 | 192 | yes | 0.00% | **0.00%** |
  | `CodeXGLUE/py/102` | 164 | 164 | yes | 14.58% | **0.00%** |
  | `CodeXGLUE/ts/201` | 130 | 130 | yes | 0.00% | **0.00%** |
  | `CodeXGLUE/ts/202` | 49 | 49 | yes | 0.00% | **0.00%** |
  | `CodeXGLUE/js/301` | 112 | 112 | yes | 0.00% | **0.00%** |

  `avgReduction` 7.8210% → **0.0000%**. `fallbackRate` (0.40) and `totalValidationIssues`
  (4) are unchanged — neither was computed across the seam. The four rows already reading
  0.00% are the fallbacks, where the *bench* ratio compared two tokenizer-derived numbers;
  their `trace.tokenAfter` was still inflated, so MCP reported a saving on them too
  (`CodeXGLUE/py/101`: 53 → 48, a phantom 9.4% on a pure fallback). That is now 53 → 53.

  **Gateway results in this repo are unaffected and should not be re-corrected.** The
  figures recorded in `docs/phase-1-stabilization-summary.md` §9 and `NOTES-FOR-DOCS.md`
  (66%, 98.59%, 0%) were derived from HTTP body byte lengths, not from these counters. The
  Gateway's internal `rawTokens`/`optimizedTokens` do change unit — measured 8,470 → 10,059
  on a 36 KB payload — but its `dedupRatio` moves only 49.79% → 49.82%, because both of its
  sides already used the same estimator.

- **Regression guard**: `test/unit/token-estimator-unity.test.ts` pins byte-identical
  input and output to exactly 0% reduction on the engine path, on the fallback path, and
  for every stage in the catalog. Verified to fail against the pre-fix source (`expected 87
  to be 106` on `HumanEval/0`), not merely to pass against the fixed one.

### Changed
- **Bench Evaluator Classifies Instead of Hardcoding (Issue 2, follow-up)**:
  `src/bench/evaluator.ts` hardcoded `contentType: 'code'` on the two items it builds for
  AST quality checks. Both now call `classifyContent`, completing the removal of hardcoded
  content-type literals begun in the Gateway relabel.

  **This moves no benchmark number.** `selectValidator` dispatches
  `language` → `path` → `contentType`, and `BenchmarkFixture.language` is a required field
  always set to `python`, `typescript` or `javascript` — all matched by the first arm — so
  `contentType` is never consulted for these items. Measured across all ten bundled
  fixtures at `targetReductionRatio: 0.30`, before and after are byte-identical:

  | Fixture | Lang | In | Out | Reduction | Fallback | rawSyntaxValid | optSyntaxValid | Symbol | Similarity | Passed |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | `HumanEval/0` | python | 106 | 106 | 0.00% | yes | true | true | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | true |
  | `HumanEval/1` | python | 146 | 146 | 0.00% | yes | true | true | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | true |

  Aggregates, also identical: `fallbackRate = 1`, `avgReduction = 0.0000%`,
  `syntaxPassRate = 1`, `passAt1Rate = 1`, `totalValidationIssues = 11`, and
  `evaluateDataset` → `rawPassRate = 1`, `optimizedPassRate = 1`, `passRateDelta = 0`,
  `avgKeySymbolPreservation = 1.000000`, `avgTokenSimilarity = 1.000000`.

  The 100% fallback rate is pre-existing and unrelated: nine fixtures exceed the drift
  threshold (`0.60 > 0.40`) and `CodeXGLUE/ts/202` fails AST validation with an unclosed
  bracket. Reduction figures come from the optimization pipeline via
  `fixtureToOptimizationRequest`, which already classified correctly through
  `createContextBundle` — the evaluator only computes post-hoc quality metrics and cannot
  affect them.

  **C1 interaction, checked explicitly:** all ten fixtures carry a `.py`/`.ts`/`.js` path,
  so extension-only code detection (`642abcb`) still classifies every one as `code`. The
  computed tag differs from the old literal on exactly one constructible input — a CodeXGLUE
  item with no `path`, which the loader synthesizes as `src/item_<id>.txt` and which
  classifies `text`. That is not a C1 regression: pre-C1 the only content signal for `code`
  was a fence, and plain source has none.

  **Not fixed, and verified rather than assumed:** with `language` absent, both the old
  literal and the computed tag yield `code` for a `.py` path, and `contentType: 'code'`
  selects the **TypeScript** validator — so a Python fixture would be parsed as TypeScript
  either way. `language` being required is the only thing preventing it, and these items
  pass the path as `origin` rather than `path`, leaving the extension arm unreachable.

### Fixed
- **Gateway Hardcoded `contentType: 'text'` (Issue 2, Commit C)**: `src/gateway/proxy.ts`
  built its context items by hand and hardcoded the content-type tag instead of calling
  `classifyContent`, the classifier every other construction site reaches through
  `createContextBundle`. That literal silently disarmed both safety nets on exactly the
  traffic a Gateway carries: `selectValidator` dispatches on `language` → `path` →
  `contentType`, and Gateway items have neither of the first two, so a `text` tag meant no
  AST validator ran at all; `DriftTracker.extractSymbols` harvests `jsonkey:` symbols only
  when `contentType === 'json'`, so a JSON payload tagged `text` yielded zero symbols and
  drift was vacuously `0.00`. Both checks reported passes they had never performed. Message
  content is now classified, and `statistics.contentTypeCounts` is derived from the items
  rather than asserted as all-`text`.

  Measured consequence, as predicted in `docs/phase-1-stabilization-summary.md` §9:
  cross-turn deduplication of a **sole copy** of `tool_output.json` moves from
  `13,785 / 13,982 = 98.59%` saved with no fallback to **0.00% and a fallback**. That is the
  drift gate working for the first time on JSON, not a regression — the prior figure
  depended on sending the model a marker it had no way to resolve. Within-payload
  duplication, where a referent survives in the same request, still deduplicates at
  **~66%** with no fallback.
- **Fenced Blocks Classified As Code**: `classifyContent` treated a triple-backtick fence as
  evidence of `code`, and `selectValidator` maps `code` to the **TypeScript** validator — so
  an ordinary message quoting a snippet was parsed as TypeScript, prose and all. Whether it
  passed was decided by apostrophe parity in the surrounding text: `Here's ... it's ...
  that's` leaves a quote open and the message is rejected with `AST_UNTERMINATED_STRING`,
  while the same message with one fewer contraction passes. Code is now detected by file
  extension only, and a fence counts toward `markdown`. Real code detection is unaffected —
  every path carrying source files supplies an extension. See `DECISIONS.md` §17.
- **Gateway Ran Without Any Safety Net (Phase 1.0b)**: `src/gateway/proxy.ts` called
  `runSessionDedupStage()` directly, so the proxy path executed no validators, no
  `DriftTracker`/`ConfidenceLedger`/`DebtTracker`, and no fallback resolver — invariants 3
  (fail-open fallback) and 5 (drift threshold) simply did not exist for live provider
  traffic. The proxy now routes through `core/engine.optimize()` and records a genuinely
  computed `fallbackUsed`. A rejected transform returns the caller's original payload
  byte-for-byte.
- **Planner Budget Trigger**: `isKnapsackMode` now also triggers on
  `budget.targetReductionRatio`, not just `maxInputTokens` — previously a budget supplying
  only `--target-reduction-ratio` silently resolved to `pass_through` mode with zero stages
  executed.
- **ESLint CI Failures**: Resolved lint issues breaking CI (`src/config/load.ts`,
  `src/core/hashing/tokenizer.ts`, related tests).
- **Design Gaps — Git Caching, Tokenizer, Versioning, Config Schema**: Follow-up fixes
  across `src/config/load.ts`, `src/config/schema.ts`, `src/core/hashing/tokenizer.ts`,
  `src/core/topology/git-inspector.ts`, and adapter entry points.

### Added
- **`session_dedup` Planner Mode**: New `OptimizationMode` planning exactly
  `['cleanup:session-dedup']`. Selected via `config.planner.defaultMode` (previously dead
  config) and takes precedence over budget-derived knapsack mode. The Gateway pins it so
  `compression:token-hashing` — which corrupts JSON-shaped message content (Issue 2) —
  cannot reach live provider payloads.

### Changed
- **Drift Exempts Recoverable Elisions**: `cleanup:session-dedup` now tags its elisions
  `recoverable: true`, and `DriftTracker` substitutes the pre-optimization content for
  those items before scoring. A dedup marker is a reference to text still held in the
  session store, not semantic loss; scoring it as drift made `S_k` fire hardest exactly
  when deduplication worked best (measured 0.60 for a code payload that now scores 0.00).
  Lossy elisions (`token-hashing`, `delta-compression`) set no such flag and are still
  scored in full.
- **Documentation**: Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and `ROADMAP.md` for v2.0
  planning.

## [v1.1.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added
- **Config Schema Versioning**: Added `configSchemaVersion: "1.1"` support with automatic legacy migration.
- **Git Workspace Caching**: Added in-memory TTL caching for `git status` commands, greatly speeding up Git inspections during proxy sessions.
- **Heuristic Tokenizer**: Replaced the naive character count estimator with an optimized, zero-dependency `EnhancedHeuristicTokenizer`.

### Performance
- **Tokenizer Speedup**: Optimized the heuristic tokenizer using `charCodeAt` to achieve a 3.5x performance boost.

## [v1.0.3] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed
- **CLI Executable Resolution**: Fixed "command not found" error following global installation (`npm install -g tokendamper`) by updating `"bin"` configuration in `package.json` to explicitly map `"./dist/src/cli/main.js"`.
- **Shebang & Environment Integrity**: Validated CLI entrypoint shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env node`) to ensure seamless execution on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Changed
- **Version Alignment**: Synced package version, `CLI_ADAPTER_VERSION`, and MCP `SERVER_VERSION` to `1.0.3`.

## [v1.0.2] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed
- **Engine Fallback Data Integrity**: Fixed a critical bug where the engine returned the corrupted intermediate bundle in `finalBundle` instead of the original request bundle when fallback was triggered. Consumers inspecting `result.finalBundle` after a fallback now correctly receive the original unmodified bundle.
- **Topology Scoring Performance**: Replaced per-item multi-source BFS (O(N × V²)) with a single batch `computeAllDistances()` call using an O(1) head-index dequeue, reducing topology scoring to O(V + E + N). Eliminates event loop freezes on repositories with 500+ files.
- **hashContent Crash on Undefined**: Guarded `stableSerialize()` against `undefined` return from `JSON.stringify()` (triggered by `undefined`, `Symbol`, or `Function` inputs) which previously crashed `createHash().update()` with a fatal `TypeError`.
- **Benchmark Runner Flaky Test**: Increased timeout for the `should execute offline deterministic benchmark sweeps` test from 5s to 15s to prevent false failures on slower CI runners.

### Changed
- **Version Alignment**: Synced `CLI_ADAPTER_VERSION` and MCP `SERVER_VERSION` from `0.1.0` to `1.0.2` to match the published package version. All traces, MCP `initialize` responses, and diagnostic outputs now report the correct version.

## [v1.0.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added
- **MCP Adapter**: Implemented a Model Context Protocol (MCP) stdio JSON-RPC 2.0 server for Claude Desktop and Cursor integration.
- **Gateway HTTP Proxy**: Built a local proxy server to transparently intercept and optimize Anthropic/OpenAI API requests from CLI tools (`tokendamper exec`).
- **0/1 Knapsack Planner**: Introduced an optimal value-density knapsack solver for packing context nodes under strict token constraints.
- **Reversible Token Hashing**: Added `TokenHasher` for eliding repetitive context with `<BLOCK_HASH:sha256>` placeholders.
- **Delta Compression**: Implemented line-based Myers diff algorithm to transmit only changed lines across conversation turns.
- **Visual Diff Reporters**: Added visual terminal ANSI diff (`--diff`) and beautiful HTML report exporter (`--diff-html <path>`).
- **Explainability Ledgers**: Introduced Optimization Debt ($D_k$) & Semantic Drift ($S_k$) tracking to enforce long-term session safety limits.

### Changed
- **Engine Emission Contract**: The core linear engine now fully emits optimized bundle text back to callers when validation successfully passes, seamlessly integrating with execution workflows.

### Security
- **Gateway Token Auth**: Implemented `x-tokendamper-token` authentication to secure the local Gateway proxy.
- **Payload Size Limits**: Enforced strict 10MB input limits on MCP stdio and Gateway streams.
- **Upstream Abort Timeouts**: Configured request timeouts to protect against upstream LLM hangs.
- **Bounded LRU Session Stores**: Capped active `GatewaySessionStore` metrics and MCP `traceStore` entries with eviction strategies to guarantee stable memory footprints over unbounded sessions.
