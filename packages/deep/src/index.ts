/**
 * `tokendamper-deep` — the Deep-mode backends, backed by tree-sitter compiled to WASM.
 *
 * **Unpublished in R3.** Its job this release is to be *measured against* the shipped Fast
 * path on the four languages Fast already covers, which is the only ground where a
 * disagreement can still be hand-checked. R4 publishes it and adds languages.
 *
 * ## The async boundary
 *
 * `Parser.init()` and `Language.load()` are async; `ParserAdapter` is not, and neither is
 * `AstValidator.validate` or any caller below it — the engine, the fallback resolver and
 * three adapters. So **all async work happens here, at construction**, and every adapter
 * method is synchronous thereafter. That constraint is §3.4's and it is what keeps the seam
 * from rippling an `await` through the pipeline to buy nothing.
 *
 * `Parser.init()` is per-process and its cost lands in the harness's `fixed` bucket rather
 * than in engine time (DECISIONS §76). It is measured rather than assumed — §75 lists it as a
 * plausible reason Deep could be unusable at the CLI while fine at the Gateway.
