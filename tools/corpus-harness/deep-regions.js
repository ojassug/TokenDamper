/**
 * R3 step 3 — classifies every row where deep-mode output differs from fast-mode output.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node tools/corpus-harness/deep-regions.js <fast-run-dir> <deep-run-dir> --out <file.json>
 *
 * ## Why two fallback numbers and not one
 *
 * §3.5 says "fallbacks must not rise". This split was designed when Deep's `check()` was meant
 * to run live on the optimize path: §80 measured a 9.28% TypeScript disagreement rate between
 * Deep's validator and Fast's, so a `new-fallback-validator` row would usually be Deep's own
 * validator being *wrong* where the grammar lags the language — expected noise, reported but
 * not gated.
 *
 * **That premise no longer holds, and this comment used to keep telling the old story.** Deep's
 * `check()` rejects TokenDamper's own elision marker (`[TokenDamper: N function-body lines
 * elided, …]` is not valid TypeScript or Python), so deep validation and elision cannot be
 * combined, and `validationMode` now defaults to `'fast'` for exactly that reason (see the "two
 * axes" comment in `src/core/engine/index.ts`). **Both arms of this comparison validate through
 * the identical Fast lexer, regardless of `--mode`. Deep's validator does not run in
 * either run.**
 *
 * So a `new-fallback-validator` row no longer means "Deep's validator disagreed with Fast's" —
 * that class of disagreement cannot reach this comparison at all. It means the deep arm
 * produced a fallback whose reason carries an AST error from **Fast's own validator**, on
 * content the same validator accepted in the fast arm. The only thing that differs between the
 * two arms is which regions were chosen. That makes it a region defect — Deep picked a boundary
 * whose elision Fast's validator rejects — surfacing through a different symptom than a
 * `new-fallback-region` row, and arguably the more serious of the two: the spliced output was
 * rejected outright rather than merely scored worse.
 *
 * The two buckets stay separate because *which* symptom a region defect announces itself as is
 * still worth knowing. But **both gate at zero for this measurement, not just
 * region-attributable.** Collapsing them would hide a region regression behind a label that
 * used to mean "expected" and no longer does.
 *
 * ## What it refuses
 *
 *  - an empty comparison set — the shape a bad glob produces, and it reads as agreement
 *  - a row present in one run and missing from the other
 *  - a deep run whose `parserCoverage.backendAnswered` is 0 on every row: that is a deep run
 *    that never ran deep, and it would report perfect agreement

/**
 * Reads one measure.js run.
 *
 * The file is `results-<variant>.jsonl` — **JSONL, one object per line**, not a JSON array —
 * and a row's identity is `corpusPath` **and** `route`, because measure.js runs every file
 * through both routes and asserts `rows.length === files × routes`. Keying on the path alone
 * silently collapses each pair, halving the comparison while still reporting agreement.
