/**
 * R3 step 1 — Deep `symbols()`, measured against the shipped extractor.
 *
 * **The assertion is "equal or superset", and the direction matters.** §59 measured the hazard
 * this test exists to catch: a symbol set that is *structurally incapable of registering body
 * elision* passes every gate having witnessed nothing. Go files with a `struct` and an `import`
 * scored `S_k = 0.0000` with `astMeasured: true` while every function body in them had been
 * deleted, because `type:Point` and `import:fmt` survive body elision by construction.
 *
 * So a backend that returns *fewer* symbols is dangerous, and a backend that returns *more*
 * symbols is only safe if the extra ones are destroyed by body elision like the rest. The
 * second half is what `S_k must not fall on a hand-elided control` checks, further down.
 *
 * Nothing here is wired to elision. Step 1 ships symbols alone, which is the ordering §56
 * measured and the `widen-language` skill encodes.

/**
 * **Equality, not superset — and the design's "equal or superset" needs this qualification.**
 *
 * A superset is only safe when the extra symbols are ones body elision destroys. The symbols a
 * parser most easily finds *extra* are the opposite: `import:` and `type:` are signature-level
 * and survive body elision by construction, so adding them raises `R_AST` toward 1 and
 * therefore *lowers* `S_k` for the same transform. That is the falling drift score §59
 * measured, arriving through the front door.
 *
 * So the target here is set equality, and every disagreement found on the way to it was read
 * rather than tuned away. Two were real and both were on Go:
 *
 *  - the shipped `jsImportRegex` cannot match a **grouped** `import ( … )` block, so it misses
 *    `import:math` and `import:fmt`. Deep found them, which *lowers* drift — refused here.
 *  - `var Origin = 0.0` at the top level: the shipped column-0 regex catches it and Deep's
 *    first draft did not, because `var_spec` is nested inside `var_declaration`. A lost symbol
 *    is the other dangerous direction — fixed.
 *
 * The first is a defect in the shipped extractor that Deep must **not** fix in R3, because R3's
 * constraint is no reduction change and fixing it would move files across the drift gate. It is
 * recorded for R4.

 *  - Deep invents an always-retained symbol -> `R_AST` rises -> §59's hazard. Found twice, in
 *    Go grouped imports and annotated top-level consts, and refused in `symbols.ts`.
 *  - Deep declines to invent a phantom -> `R_AST` rises -> harmless.
 *
 * Measured on the frozen corpus: **0** files of the first kind, 9 of the second. The tool is
