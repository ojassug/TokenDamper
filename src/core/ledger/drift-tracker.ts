/**
 * Content types for which markdown structural markers (`#` headings, ``` fences, `---`

 *
 * Deliberately an allowlist, not a denylist of `code`/`yaml`. A new `ContentType` should
 * default to *not* harvesting these — an absent marker costs a little discrimination, an
 * invented one actively inflates drift, and the second failure is the one that has
 * actually bitten (DECISIONS.md §18, `docs/phase-1d-drift-investigation.md` §7). [retired]
 *
 * **`markdown` alone, since Phase 4b.3 (DECISIONS §32).** The list used to also hold `text`,
 * `html`, `logs` and `unknown`, which contradicted the paragraph above: `text` and `unknown`
 * are the two "we could not tell" buckets, and a bucket that means *we do not know what this
 * is* cannot also mean *its `#` lines are headings*. `#`, ``` and `---` are not HTML or log
 * syntax either.
 *
 * Measured over five frozen corpora before the change, the four removed members yielded
 * **zero** gated markers between them — 62 `text` files, one `html`, one `logs`, and
 * `unknown` is only ever returned for empty content. So this is a consistency fix with no
 * measured behavioural change, and it is worth having only because the trap is latent:
 * anything that starts classifying code as `text` gets the fabrication back for free.
 *
 * **Where the fabrication actually lives is `markdown`, and removing it from this list is not
 * the answer** — see DECISIONS §32. `looksLikeMarkdown` fires on a single `#` heading, so
 * every hash-commented shell script is markdown, and its comment lines are harvested as
 * headings by construction. That is recorded, measured and deliberately not fixed here.

    // 3. Go functions and methods.
    //
    // **Step 1 of widening elision to Go, and alone in its commit on purpose (DECISIONS
    // §56).** `extractSymbols` is regex over `item.content` and never consults
    // `selectValidator`, which makes it the one gate that can be widened while the language is
    // still unelidable — and it is the one that has to go first. Probed on real Go before this
    // block existed, the only symbols harvested were `type:Point` (because `struct` is an
    // alternative in the class regex below) and `import:fmt`. Both are signature-level and
    // **survive body elision by construction**, so a region scanner shipped first would score
    // `R_AST = 1.0` with `astMeasured: true` on a file whose every function body had been
    // deleted. §33 closed the case where the before-set is empty; this is its sibling — a
    // before-set that is non-empty but structurally incapable of registering the loss — and on
    // the CLI, where elision is irreversible, that is data loss every gate reports as green.
    //
    // `func` is why Go is the first language added: an unambiguous header keyword, where C's
    // `int foo(...)` cannot be told from a prototype. Anchored to the start of a line because a
    // Go function declaration is always a top-level one — which also stops `func` inside a
    // string literal, or mid-sentence in a comment, from inventing a symbol.
    //
    // The trailing `[([]` admits the generic form (`func Map[T any](...)`) without balancing
    // brackets: the name is what identifies the function, and the type parameter list is not
    // needed to find it.
    //
    // Deliberately **not** harvested — anonymous literals (`x := func() {}`) and func types
    // (`type Handler func(int) error`) have no name to take, and an interface method
    // declaration has no body, so harvesting it would add one more symbol that survives elision
    // by construction. That is the exact dependency this block exists to remove.

    // and losing ten of them would read as losing one. The receiver is right there in the
    // syntax, and nothing downstream parses these strings (they are only ever set-compared for
    // `R_AST`), so the resolution costs nothing.

    // body counted as a semantic symbol on par with an exported function — and body elision
    // is precisely the transform that removes them. Measured on this repo at
    // `targetReductionRatio: 0.5`, on the two files whose drift scores sit closest to the
    // gate:
    //
    //   src/core/hashing/tokenizer.ts   9 of 17 symbols "lost" — all 9 function-local
    //   src/core/engine/index.ts       42 of 63 symbols "lost" — 41 function-local
    //
    // Not one exported function, type or interface was lost in either case, because
    // `selectElisionRegions` retains signatures by construction. So `R_AST` was reporting
    // 66.7% semantic loss for a file that had lost no API surface at all, and the audit's
    // "you can destroy two-thirds of every symbol in a file and pass" was measuring
    // temporaries inside bodies the caller asked to have elided.

   * "lost" symbols it had never touched: 101 of curl's 126 drift fallbacks (§86). C and C# have no
   * baseline to move, so they take the backend's names alone. TypeScript, Python and Go keep their
   * regexes in both modes; whether Deep's symbols should replace those is §79's open question.
   *
