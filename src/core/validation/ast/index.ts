  // for a different grammar. That is not a weaker check; it is a check that invents findings:
  //
  //   shell       22 of 40   (55%)  AST_UNTERMINATED_STRING / AST_UNBALANCED_BRACKET
  //   powershell   7 of 40   (18%)

  //   tcl         30 of 40   (75%)
  //   c / css      0 of 50    (0%)   ← C-family; the scanner happens to fit, and finds nothing
  //
  // Shell and PowerShell are *in* `isCodeExtension` today, so those are live false verdicts
  // on the file route: `$'…'` quoting, `'` inside comments, `${…}` expansion and `[[ … ]]`
  // tests are all ordinary syntax that a TS lexer reads as an unterminated string or an
  // unbalanced bracket. This is DECISIONS §17's finding — a verdict decided by apostrophe
  // parity is not validating anything — reached from the extension side instead of the fence
  // side, and it is removed for the same reason rather than tuned.
  //
  // Nothing that was genuinely covered loses coverage: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python and
  // JSON all reach their validator through the `language` and `path` branches in
  // `selectValidator`, which run *first* and are unchanged. What changes is that the
  // remainder now report `validated: false` and appear on `trace.astCoverage`, which is
  // §23's distinction — an unexamined item is not a passing one.
  //
  // **Go joined that list in §60 and did not change this entry.** It reaches `GoValidator`
  // through the same two branches, by its own grammar rather than by being lexed as
  // TypeScript — which is the distinction this `null` exists to preserve, not one it
  // contradicts.
  //
  // **C and C# joined in R4 (§84) the same way**, by declared language and by path, through
  // their own lexers — `code` still selects nothing.

 * lookup with the hardcoded chain as its fallback"* and *"the existing if-chain stays and
 * stays first"*. Both hold, because the switch is the **mode**:
 *
 *  - `fast`, the default, resolves through the chain below and **never reads the registry**.
 *    Fast must not change behaviour because Deep exists, and the shipped path must not
 *    depend on a registry being populated.
 *  - `deep` resolves the language through the same chain, then hands the item to a
 *    registered backend for that language — falling back to the chain's own validator when
 *    none is registered.
 *
 * **Deep keys off the chain's answer rather than resolving the language itself**, which is
 * what confines R3 to the four languages Fast already covers. Two item-to-language rules can
 * disagree about what a file is, and that disagreement would surface as a *parser*
 * difference in the step-2 measurement — a backend blamed for a classification defect.
