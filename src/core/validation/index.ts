  // by the extractor that produces `symbolsBefore` (DECISIONS §59).
  //
  // It counted validator-covered items — `astCoverage.checked` arriving a second way, under a
  // name asserting a fact about symbols that nothing had checked. The two agreed for as long as
  // every language with symbols also had a validator and every language without one had neither,
  // so they agreed by coincidence of coverage rather than by construction.
  //
  // They come apart in both directions, and both are measured:
  //
  //   - Go between §59 and §60 was the first language to have symbols without a validator. On 80
  //     frozen Go files, the file route reported `symbolsBefore = 3`+ next to
  //     `symbolBearingItems = 0` on **all 80** — a self-contradicting pair on one trace. §60
  //     closed that by giving Go a validator, which fixed the symptom for one language and left
  //     the field still counting the wrong thing.
  //   - The reverse case is in this repository and always was: six of its own `src/**/*.ts`
  //     files are barrels that a validator covers and that yield no symbols at all. Those are
  //     precisely the files §28 and §33 exist to protect, and the field claimed symbols were the
  //     witness standing behind them.
  //
  // §60 left it deliberately, on the grounds that a trace field consumers parse should not be
  // changed as a ride-along in the commit that exposed it. This is that decision taken on its
  // own: the number moves for any bundle where coverage and symbol-bearing disagree.
  //
  // The old set also scoped the unwitnessed-item rule until Phase A, so the rule could not fire
  // on anything no validator covered — which was exactly the population being deleted
  // unwitnessed (§33). `calculateDrift` has not taken it since, so removing it here is a pure
  // reporting change.

  // Computed over `before`, not `after`: the question is what this build could have done to the
  // input, which is a property of the input's languages and does not depend on what the stages
