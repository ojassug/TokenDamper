/**
 * Loads `tokendamper-deep` and registers every backend it carries.
 *
 * **Two resolution paths, and the order is the migration.** The bare specifier is the R4
 * shape, once the package is published or linked. The repo-relative path is the R3 shape: the
 * package is `private: true` and the workspace is not linked into `node_modules`, and linking
 * it means an `npm install` that reaches the main checkout. `deep-parity.js` resolves it
 * exactly this way and prints the same build instruction.
 *
 * **An empty registry is an error, not a fall-through.** `--mode deep` that silently
 * ran Fast is invariant 10 in its purest form — a green result from a path that never
 * executed. DECISIONS §54 set the precedent when an unrecognised `TOKENDAMPER_*` enum value
 * became a hard error rather than a silent default.
