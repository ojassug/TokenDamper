 * `tokendamper optimize .` on a repository containing `secrets.yaml`, `serviceAccount.json` or
 * `config/credentials.yaml` reads them and writes them to stdout, which is the stream the caller
 * then pipes into a model. Reproduced: three secret-bearing files, all three named in
 * `.gitignore`, all three ingested and emitted verbatim.
 *
 * **This reports; it does not filter.** Skipping ignored files would change which bytes the
 * pipeline sees, and `.gitignore` covers plenty a caller may legitimately mean to optimize —
 * build output, vendored sources, generated code. Naming them costs nothing and leaves the
 * decision where it belongs. A file named directly on the command line is still taken, unchanged:
 * naming a path is a statement that you want it.
 *
 * `execFile` with an argument array and the paths on **stdin**, so no filename is ever interpolated
 * into a command line — a path beginning with `-` cannot become a flag, and `git check-ignore`'s
 * `--stdin` form is what makes that possible. Any failure is silent by design: no git, no
 * repository, or a git too old for these flags all mean "cannot answer", and a warning system that
 * errors is worse than one that says nothing.
